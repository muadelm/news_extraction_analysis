      " \n",
      "Green hydrogen can help to decarbonize parts of the transportation sector, but its power sector interactions are not well understood so far. It may contribute to integrating variable renewable energy sources if production is sufficiently flexible in time. Using an open-source co-optimization model of the power sector and four options for supplying hydrogen at German filling stations, we find a trade-off between energy efficiency and temporal flexibility. For lower shares of renewables and hydrogen, more energy-efficient and less flexible small-scale on-site electrolysis is optimal. For higher shares of renewables and/or hydrogen, more flexible but less energy-efficient large-scale hydrogen supply chains gain importance, as they allow to temporally disentangle hydrogen production from demand via storage. Liquid hydrogen emerges as particularly beneficial, followed by liquid organic hydrogen carriers and gaseous hydrogen. Large-scale hydrogen supply chains can deliver substantial power sector benefits, mainly through reduced renewable curtailment. Energy modelers and system planners should consider the distinct flexibility characteristics of hydrogen supply chains in more detail when assessing the role of green hydrogen in future energy transition scenarios. We also propose two alternative cost and emission metrics which could be useful in future analyses.\n",

      "Future energy systems could rely on hydrogen (H2) to achieve decarbonisation and net-zero goals. In a similar energy landscape to natural gas, H2 emissions occur along the supply chain. It has been studied how current gas infrastructure can support H2, but there is little known about how H2 emissions affect global warming as an indirect greenhouse gas. In this work, we have estimated for the first time the potential emission profiles (g CO2eq/MJ H2,HHV) of H2 supply chains, and found that the emission rates of H2 from H2 supply chains and methane from natural gas supply are comparable, but the impact on global warming is much lower based on current estimates. This study also demonstrates the critical importance of establishing mobile H2 emission monitoring and reducing the uncertainty of short-lived H2 climate forcing so as to clearly address H2 emissions for net-zero strategies.\n",

      "Hydrogen has been identified as one of the key elements to bolster longer-term climate neutrality and strategic autonomy for several major countries. Multiple road maps emphasize the need to accelerate deployment across its supply chain and utilization. Being one of the major contributors to global CO2 emissions, the transportation sector finds in hydrogen an appealing alternative to reach sustainable development through either its direct use in fuel cells or further transformation to sustainable fuels. This review summarizes the latest developments in hydrogen use across the major energy-consuming transportation sectors. Rooted in a systems engineering perspective, we present an analysis of the entire hydrogen supply chain across its economic, environmental, and social dimensions. Providing an outlook on the sector, we discuss the challenges hydrogen faces in penetrating the different transportation markets.

      " \n",
      "Upgrading lactate/carbohydrate-rich waste biomass into medium-chain carboxylic acids (MCCAs) by chain elongation (CE) technology exhibits economic and environmental benefits. However, the largely dispersive lactate-carbon-flow decreases MCCAs yield. This work discovered appropriate H2 supply could significantly reduce lactate-carbon-flow loss and improve MCCAs production (∼1.65 times) when the system is not operated according to well-defined operating conditions, and revealed corresponding mechanism. Hydrogen (H2) supply largely enhanced electron efficiency and electron transfer capacity, and H2 could reduce propionate (from competing acrylate pathway, which should be prevented, but when not possible, the carbon recovery from propionate is possible) to propanol, which was used as electron donor to elongate acetate and propionate. Moreover, H2 could react with CO2 (from CE process) to sequentially generate acetate and ethanol, which further contributed to caproate/caprylate generation. Comparing with non-H2-supplemented test, the lactate-carbon-flow used for MCCAs production was enhanced by ∼28.4% after H2 supply, and Clostridium spp. were the key discriminative microorganisms.\n",

      " \n",
      "Coronavirus (COVID-19) is highly infectious agent that causes fatal respiratory illnesses, which is of great global public health concern. Currently, there is no effective vaccine for tackling this COVID19 pandemic where disease countermeasures rely upon preventing or slowing person-to-person transmission. Specifically, there is increasing efforts to prevent or reduce transmission to front-line healthcare workers (HCW). However, there is growing international concern regarding the shortage in supply chain of critical one-time-use personal and protective equipment (PPE). PPE are heat sensitive and are not, by their manufacturer's design, intended for reprocessing. Most conventional sterilization technologies used in hospitals, or in terminal medical device sterilization providers, cannot effectively reprocess PPE due to the nature and severity of sterilization modalities. Contingency planning for PPE stock shortage is important. Solutions in the Republic of Ireland include use of smart communication channels to improve supply chain, bespoke production of PPE to meets gaps, along with least preferred option, use of sterilization or high-level disinfection for PPE reprocessing. Reprocessing PPE must consider material composition, functionality post treatment, along with appropriate disinfection. Following original manufacturer of PPE and regulatory guidance is important. Technologies deployed in the US, and for deployment in the Republic of Ireland, are eco-friendly, namely vaporised hydrogen peroxide (VH2O2), such as for filtering facepiece respirators and UV irradiation and High-level liquid disinfection (Actichlor+) is also been pursed in Ireland. Safeguarding supply chain of PPE will sustain vital healthcare provision and will help reduce mortality.\n",

      " \n",
      "PurposeUnder times of supply chain stress, the availability of some medical equipment and supplies may become limited. The current pandemic involving severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 has highlighted limitations to the ordinary provision of personal protective equipment (PPE). For perioperative healthcare workers, N95 masks provide a stark example of PPE in short supply necessitating the creation of scientifically valid protocols for their decontamination and reuse.MethodsWe performed a systematic literature search of MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane CENTRAL databases, and ClinicalTrials.gov to identify peer-reviewed articles related to N95 mask decontamination and subsequent testing for the integrity of mask filtration and facial seal. To expand this search, we additionally surveyed the official statements from key health agencies, organizations, and societies for relevant citations.ResultsOur initial database search resulted in five articles that met inclusion criteria, with 26 articles added from the expanded search. Our search did not reveal any relevant randomized clinical trials or cohort studies. We found that moist mask heating (65–80°C at 50–85% relative humidity for 20–30 min) and vaporous hydrogen peroxide treatment were supported by the literature to provide consistent viral decontamination without compromising mask seal and filtration efficiency. Other investigated decontamination methods lacked comprehensive scientific evidence for all three of these key criteria.ConclusionsN95 mask reprocessing using either moist heat or vaporous hydrogen peroxide is recommended to ensure healthcare worker safety.\n",

      " \n",
      "Advancement of a hydrogen economy requires establishment of a whole supply chain including hydrogen production, purification, storage, utilization, and recovery. Nevertheless, it remains challenging to selectively purify hydrogen out of H2-containing streams, especially at low concentrations. Herein, a novel protonic ceramic electrochemical cell is reported that can sustainably separate pure H2 out of H2-diluted streams over the temperature regime of 350-500 °C by mildly controlling the electric voltage. With the Faraday's efficiency above 96%, the measured H2 separation rate at 0.51 V and 500 °C is 3.3 mL cm-2 min-1 out of 10% H2 - 90% N2, or 2.4 mL cm-2 min-1 out of 10% H2 - 90% CH4 taken as an example of renewable hydrogen blended in the natural gas pipelines. Such high hydrogen separation capability at reduced temperatures is enabled by the nanoporous nickel catalysts and well-bonded electrochemical interfaces as produced from well-controlled in situ slow reduction of nickel oxides. These results demonstrate technical feasibility of onsite purification of hydrogen prior to their practical applications such as fuels for fuel cell electric vehicles.\n",

      " \n",
      "Chain elongation produce medium chain carboxylates, which are important precursors to many pharmaceuticals, antimicrobials and biofuels. Results in the presented investigations show that the supply of nano zero-valent iron (NZVI) can enhance caproate production. The highest caproate concentration achieved amounted to 27.2 mmol/L when 5 g/L NZVI were added, which was about 100% higher than the control. The study also showed increase of ethanol oxidation and decrease of butyrate and butanol with NZVI addition. Mechanism study showed NZVI can stimulate caproate production by preventing pH to fall below 5.4 through displacement reaction. Electron balance analysis displayed that NZVI provides extra electron by promoting ethanol oxidation and its dissolution. H2 was the potential electron shuttle between NZVI and chain elongators; High throughput sequencing showed function of NZVI on reshaping of microbial communities, especially enriching Oscillibacter Marseille-P3260, a kind of chain elongator and Corynebacterium which possesses fatty acid biosynthesis and iron utilization.\n",

      " \n",
      "Green methanol could play a major role in decarbonising both the chemical and energy sectors. While techno-economic and environmental studies on green methanol following a life-cycle perspective are available, its social implications from a supply-chain standpoint remain largely unexplored. In order to fill this gap, this work presents the first social life cycle assessment of green methanol produced with CO2 directly captured from the air and hydrogen from wind power electrolysis. When compared to conventional methanol from natural gas, the results suggest an unfavourable performance of green methanol under negative social indicators (forced labour, women in the sectoral labour force, health expenditure, social responsibility promotion, and fair salary) due to the increased supply-chain complexity of the green system. In contrast, green methanol would outperform its conventional counterpart in terms of sectoral contribution to economic development, a positive social indicator which would benefit from the increase in working hours. Besides future consideration of a higher number of positive indicators and potential improvements in country- and sector-specific risk levels towards high-quality social and working conditions, an enhanced social life-cycle performance of green methanol requires technical improvements to reduce the high demand for energy inputs and equipment across its supply chain. Acknowledging decarbonisation as the actual driver of green methanol deployment, future social studies are suggested to focus on the comparison of renewable alternatives for its production and the effect of social regulations.\n",

      "We aim to predict the population density of Salmonella spp. through the pork supply chain under dynamic environmental conditions (pH, a(w) and temperature) that fluctuate from growth to survival/slow inactivation. To do this, the dependence of the probability of growth, and of the growth and inactivation rate on the temperature, pH and a(w) were modelled. Probabilistic and kinetic measurements, i.e. growth and survival curves, were collected from the ComBase database (www.combase.cc). Conditions at which selected data used to fit the models were generated covered wide ranges that are relevant to the pork supply chain. Probabilistic and kinetic models were combined to give predictions on the concentration of Salmonella spp. at any stage of the pork supply chain under fluctuating pH, a(w) and/or temperature. Models were implemented in a user-friendly computing tool freely available from http://www.ifr.ac.uk/safety/SalmonellaPredictions/. This program provides estimates on the population dynamics of Salmonella spp. at any stage of the pork supply chain and its predictive performance has been validated in several pork products.\n",

      " \n",
      "Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a well-known inhibitor of the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC). H2S also increases intracellular Ca2+ levels in astrocytes, which are glial cells and that supply lactate as an energy substrate to neurons. Here, we examined the relationship between H2S-induced metabolic changes and Ca2+ responses in spinal cord astrocytes. Na2S (150 μM), an H2S donor, increased the intracellular Ca2+ concentration, which was inhibited by an ETC inhibitor and an uncoupler of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. Na2S also increased the accumulation of extracellular lactate. Na2S alone did not change intracellular ATP content, but decreased it when glycolysis was inhibited. The Na2S-induced Ca2+ increase and accumulation of extracellular lactate were inhibited by emetine, an inhibitor of translocon complex, which mediates Ca2+ leak from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Furthermore, an inhibitor of the Ca2+-sensitive NADH shuttle decreased Na2S-mediated accumulation of lactate. We conclude that inhibition of the mitochondrial ETC by H2S induces Ca2+ release from mitochondria and the ER in spinal cord astrocytes, which increases lactate production. H2S may promote glycolysis by activating the Ca2+-sensitive NADH shuttle and facilitating the supply of lactate from astrocytes to neurons.\n",

It was found that triiodothyronine-activated mGPDH represents almost the same capacity for the saturation of the respiratory chain as Complex II. Furthermore, the increase of mGPDH activity induced by triiodothyronine correlated with an increase of capacity for glycerophosphate-dependent hydrogen peroxide production. As a result of hormonal treatment, a 3-fold increase in glycerophosphate-dependent hydrogen peroxide production by liver mitochondria was detected by polarographic and luminometric measurements.\n",

      "Microbiological conversion of CO2 into biofuels and/or organic industrial feedstock is an excellent carbon-cycling strategy. Here, autotrophic anaerobic bacteria in the membrane biofilm reactor (MBfR) transferred electrons from hydrogen gas (H2 ) to inorganic carbon (IC) and produced organic acids and alcohols. We systematically varied the H2 -delivery, the IC concentration, and the hydraulic retention time in the MBfR. The relative availability of H2 versus IC was the determining factor for enabling microbial chain elongation (MCE). When the H2 :IC mole ratio was high (>2.0 mol H2 /mol C), MCE was an important process, generating medium-chain carboxylates up to octanoate (C8, 9.1 ± 1.3 mM C and 28.1 ± 4.1 mmol C m-2  d-1 ). Conversely, products with two carbons were the only ones present when the H2 :IC ratio was low (<2.0 mol H2 /mol C), so that H2 was the limiting factor. The biofilm microbial community was enriched in phylotypes most similar to the well-known acetogen Acetobacterium for all conditions tested, but phylotypes closely related with families capable of MCE (e.g., Bacteroidales, Rhodocyclaceae, Alcaligenaceae, Thermoanaerobacteriales, and Erysipelotrichaceae) became important when the H2 :IC ratio was high. Thus, proper management of IC availability and H2 supply allowed control over community structure and function, reflected by the chain length of the carboxylates and alcohols produced in the MBfR.\n",

      "In recent years, new-found interest in the hydrogen economy from both industry and academia has helped to shed light on its potential. Hydrogen can enable an energy revolution by providing much needed flexibility in renewable energy systems. As a clean energy carrier, hydrogen offers a range of benefits for simultaneously decarbonizing the transport, residential, commercial and industrial sectors. Hydrogen is shown here to have synergies with other low-carbon alternatives, and can enable a more cost-effective transition to de-carbonized and cleaner energy systems. This paper presents the opportunities for the use of hydrogen in key sectors of the economy and identifies the benefits and challenges within the hydrogen supply chain for power-to-gas, power-to-power and gas-to-gas supply pathways. While industry players have already started the market introduction of hydrogen fuel cell systems, including fuel cell electric vehicles and micro-combined heat and power devices, the use of hydrogen at grid scale requires the challenges of clean hydrogen production, bulk storage and distribution to be resolved. Ultimately, greater government support, in partnership with industry and academia, is still needed to realize hydrogen's potential across all economic sectors.This article is part of the themed issue 'The challenges of hydrogen and metals'.\n",

      " \n",
      "Potential environmental benefits have been identified for the utilization of carbon dioxide (CO2) as a feedstock for polyurethanes (PUR). CO2 can be utilized in the PUR supply chain in a wide variety of ways ranging from direct CO2 utilization for polyols as a PUR precursor, to indirect CO2 utilization for basic chemicals in the PUR supply chain. In this paper, we present a systematic exploration and environmental evaluation of all direct and indirect CO2 utilization options for flexible and rigid PUR foams. The analysis is based on an LCA-based PUR supply chain optimization model using linear programming to identify PUR production with minimal environmental impacts. The direct utilization of CO2 for polyols allows for large specific impact reductions of up to 4 kg CO2-eq. and 2 kg oil-eq. per kg CO2 utilized, but the amounts of CO2 that can be utilized are limited to 0.30 kg CO2 per kg PUR. The amount of CO2 utilized can be increased to up to 1.7 kg CO2 per kg PUR by indirect CO2 utilization in the PUR supply chain. Indirect CO2 utilization requires hydrogen (H2). The environmental impacts of H2 production strongly affect the impact of indirect CO2 utilization in PUR. To achieve optimal environmental performance under the current fossil-based H2 generation, PUR production can only utilize much less CO2 than theoretically possible. Thus, utilizing as much CO2 in the PUR supply chain as possible is not always environmentally optimal. Clean H2 production is required to exploit the full CO2 utilization potential for environmental impact reduction in PUR production.\n",

For example, in triose phosphate isomerase, a glutamate side chain (nominal pKa ≈ 4 in solution) can in fact deprotonate a CH group that is vicinal to a carbonyl (pKa ≈ 18 in solution). This is true because of three distinct interactions: (a) ground state pKa shifts due to environment polarity and electrostatics; (b) dramatic increases in effective molarity due to optimization of proximity and orientation; and (c) transition state pKa shifts due to binding interactions and the formation of strong low barrier hydrogen bonds. In this report, we review the literature showing that the sum of these three effects supplies more than enough free energy to push forward proton transfer reactions that under standard conditions are exceedingly nonspontaneous and slow.\n",

Traditional conducting materials such as solid conductors and conducting polymers are confronted with a great challenge in sophisticated production processes and mismatch at biological tissues-machine interfaces. Furthermore, the biocatalyst, the key functional component in the electron-transfer reaction for bio-signal detection denatures easily in an ionic conductive solution. Herein, a bionic strategy is elaborately developed to synthesize an ionohydrogel bioelectronic platform that possesses extracellular-matrix-like habitat by employing hydrated ionic liquids (HILs) as ionic solvent and bioprotectant. This strategy realizes an integration of ionic and enzymatic electronic circuits and minimization of the disparities between tissues and artificial machines. The Hofmeister effect of HILs on enzyme proteins and polymer chains ensures the high bioactivity of the enzymes and greatly improves the mechanical properties of the ionohydrogels. Moreover, hydrogen bonds formed by ILs, water, and polymer chains greatly improve the water-retention of the ionohydrogel and give it more practical significance. Consequently, the promising ionohydrogel is partly printed and fabricated into wearable devices as a pain-free humoral components monitor and a wireless motion-sensor.\n",

Focus is on water chains in the K channel that can supply a proton to the binuclear center (the heme a3 Fe/CuB region), the site of O2 reduction. By assessing the presence of chains of any length on a short time scale (0.1 ps), a view of the kinds of chains and their persistence is obtained. Chains from the entry of the channel on the inner membrane to Thr359 (Rhodobacter sphaeroides numbering) are often present but are blocked at that point until a rotation of the Thr359 side chain occurs, permitting formation of chains from Thr359 towards the binuclear center. No continuous hydrogen-bonded water chains are found connecting Thr359 and the binuclear center. Instead, waters hydrogen bond from Thr359 to the hydroxyl of the heme a3 farnesyl and then continue to the binuclear center via Tyr288, which has been identified as a source of a proton for O2 reduction. Three hydrogen-bonded waters are found to be present in the binuclear center after a sufficiently long simulation time. One is ligated to the CuB and could be associated with a water (or hydroxyl) identified in the crystal structure as the fourth ligand of CuB. The water hydrogen-bonded to the hydroxyl of Tyr288 is extremely persistent and well positioned to participate in O2 reduction. The third water is located where O2 is often suggested to reside in mechanistic studies of O2 reduction.\n",

Furthermore, calculations show that a Ca-decorated carbyne can adsorb up to 6 H(2) molecules per Ca atom with a binding energy of ∼0.2 eV, desirable for reversible storage, and the hydrogen storage capacity can exceed ∼8 wt %. Unlike recently reported transition metal-decorated carbon nanostructures, which suffer from the metal clustering diminishing the storage capacity, the clustering of Ca atoms on carbyne is energetically unfavorable.

At the external AP dosage of 5%, SCOD of 5363.7 mg/L (SCOD/TCOD = 32.5%) was achievable after 2-h pretreatment. More than 66% of SCOD was composed of proteins and carbohydrates. Considerable SCFAs of 607 mg COD/g VSS was produced over a short-term anaerobic fermentation of 3 days, which was 5.4 times higher than that in the control. Acetic and propionic acids accounted for 74.1% of the SCFAs. The AP-based approach increased endogenous protease and α-glucosidase activities, facilitating biodegradation of dissolved organic matters and SCFAs production.

      "BackgroundBio-hydrogen production via dark fermentation of low-value waste is a potent and simple mean of recovering energy, maximising the harvesting of reducing equivalents to produce the cleanest fuel amongst renewables. Following several position papers from companies and public bodies, the hydrogen economy is regaining interest, especially in combination with circular economy and the environmental benefits of short local supply chains, aiming at zero net emission of greenhouse gases (GHG). The biomasses attracting the largest interest are agricultural and urban green wastes (pruning of trees, collected leaves, grass clippings from public parks and boulevards), which are usually employed in compost production, with some concerns over the GHG emission during the process. Here, an alternative application of green wastes, low-value compost and intermediate products (partially composted but unsuitable for completing the process) is studied, pointing at the autochthonous microbial consortium as an already selected source of implementation for biomass degradation and hydrogen production. The biocatalysts investigated as mainly relevant for hydrogen production were the [FeFe]-hydrogenases expressed in Clostridia, given their very high turnover rates.ResultsBio-hydrogen accumulation was related to the modulation of gene expression of multiple [FeFe]-hydrogenases from two strains (Clostridium beijerinckii AM2 and Clostridium tyrobutyricum AM6) isolated from the same waste. Reverse Transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) was applied over a period of 288 h and the RT-qPCR results showed that C. beijerinckii AM2 prevailed over C. tyrobutyricum AM6 and a high expression modulation of the 6 different [FeFe]-hydrogenase genes of C. beijerinckii in the first 23 h was observed, sustaining cumulative hydrogen production of 0.6 to 1.2 ml H2/g VS (volatile solids). These results are promising in terms of hydrogen yields, given that no pre-treatment was applied, and suggested a complex cellular regulation, linking the performance of dark fermentation with key functional genes involved in bio-H2 production in presence of the autochthonous consortium, with different roles, time, and mode of expression of the involved hydrogenases.ConclusionsAn applicative outcome of the hydrogenases genes quantitative expression analysis can be foreseen in optimising (on the basis of the acquired functional data) hydrogen production from a nutrient-poor green waste and/or low added value compost, in a perspective of circular bioeconomy.\n",

      "Oxidoreductases belong to the most-applied industrial enzymes. Nevertheless, they need external electrons whose supply is often costly and challenging. Recycling of the electron donors NADH or NADPH requires the use of additional enzymes and sacrificial substrates. Interestingly, several oxidoreductases accept hydrogen peroxide as electron donor. While being inexpensive, this reagent often reduces the stability of enzymes. A solution to this problem is the in situ generation of the cofactor. The continuous supply of the cofactor at low concentration drives the reaction without impairing enzyme stability. This paper demonstrates a method for the light-catalyzed in situ generation of hydrogen peroxide with the example of the heme-dependent fatty acid decarboxylase OleTJE. The fatty acid decarboxylase OleTJE was discovered due to its unique ability to produce long-chain 1-alkenes from fatty acids, a hitherto unknown enzymatic reaction. 1-alkenes are widely used additives for plasticizers and lubricants. OleTJE has been shown to accept electrons from hydrogen peroxide for the oxidative decarboxylation. While addition of hydrogen peroxide damages the enzyme and results in low yields, in situ generation of the cofactor circumvents this problem. The photobiocatalytic system shows clear advantages regarding enzyme activity and yield, resulting in a simple and efficient system for fatty acid decarboxylation.\n",

      "The enzyme nitrogenase, when reducing natural and unnatural substrates, requires large numbers of protons per chemical catalytic cycle. The active face of the catalytic site (the FeMo-cofactor, FeMo-co) is situated in a protein domain which is largely hydrophobic and anhydrous, and incapable of serial provision of multiple protons. Through detailed analysis of the high quality protein crystal structures available the characteristics of a chain of water molecules leading from the protein surface to a key sulfur atom (S3B) of FeMo-co are described. The first half of the water chain from the surface inwards is branched, slightly variable, and able to accommodate exogenous small molecules: this is dubbed the proton bay. The second half, from the proton bay to S3B, is comprised of a single chain of eight hydrogen bonded water molecules. This section is strictly conserved, and is intimately involved in hydrogen bonds with homocitrate, an essential component that chelates Mo. This is the proton wire, and a detailed Grotthuss mechanism for serial translocation of protons through this proton wire to S3B is proposed. This controlled serial proton relay from the protein surface to S3B is an essential component of the intramolecular hydrogenation paradigm for the complete chemical mechanisms of nitrogenase. Each proton reaching S3B, instigated by electron transfer to FeMo-co, becomes a hydrogen atom that migrates to other components of the active face of FeMo-co and to bound substrates and intermediates, allowing subsequent multiple proton transfers along the proton wire. Experiments to test the proposed mechanism of proton supply are suggested. The water chain in nitrogenase is comparable with the purported proton pumping pathway of cytochrome c oxidase.\n",

      "Cel7A from Rasamsonia emersonii is one of the processive endocellulases classified under family 7 glycoside hydrolase. Molecular dynamics simulations were carried out to obtain the optimized sliding and hydrolyzing conformations, in which the reducing ends of sugar chains are located on different sites. Hydrogen bonds are investigated to clarify the interactions between protein and substrate in either conformation. Nine hydrogen bonding interactions are identified in the sliding conformation, and six similar interactions are also found correspondingly in the hydrolyzing conformation. In addition, four strong hydrophobic interactions are also determined. The domain cross-correlation map analysis shows movement correlation of protein including autocorrelation between residues. The root mean square fluctuations analysis represents the various flexibilities of different fragment in the two conformations. Comparing the two conformations reveals the water-supply mechanism of selective hydrolysis of cellulose in Cel7A. The mechanism can be described as follow. When the reducing end of substrate slides from the unhydrolyzing site (sliding conformation) to the hydrolyzing site (hydrolyzing conformation), His225 is pushed down and rotated, the rotation leads to the movement of Glu209 with the interstrand hydrogen bonding in β-sheet. It further makes Asp211 close to the hydrolysis center and provides a water molecule bounding on its carboxyl in the previous unhydrolyzing site. After the hydrolysis takes place and the product is excluded from the enzyme, the Asp211 comes back to its initial position. In summary, Asp211 acts as an elevator to transport outer water molecules into the hydrolysis site for every other glycosidic bond.\n",

For these processes empirical rate laws are used. The model is applied to calculate time-dependent states of energy transduction in isolated rat liver mitochondria. From the general agreement of the computational results with experimental data (Ogawa, S. and Lee, T.M. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 10004-10011) the following conclusions can be drawn. (1) The length of the time interval during which mitochondria are able to maintain a relatively high and constant delta pH in the absence of oxygen (anaerobiosis) is limited by the availability of intramitochondrial ATP. (2) The overshoot kinetics of delta pH which appear when reoxigenating mitochondria after a preceeding anaerobiosis might be due to a lag phase kinetics of the F0F1-ATPase. (3) In phosphorylating mitochondria the homeostasis of delta pH is brought about by a high sensitivity of the respiration rate and the rate of the F0F1-ATPase as to changes of delta pH. (4) Analysis of the mean transient times shows that the rate of ATP synthesis in State 3 is controlled to almost the same extent by the hydrogen supply, the respiratory chain, the adenine nucleotide translocator and the proton leak.\n",

Recently, the use of hydrogen oxidizing bacteria (HOB) as a platform for high quality microbial protein (MP) production has regained interest. This study aims to investigate the added value of using conditions such as salt and temperature to steer HOB communities to lower diversities, while maintaining a high protein content and a high quality amino acid profile. Pressure drop and hydrogen consumption were measured for 56 days to evaluate autotrophy of a total of six communities in serum flasks. Of the six communities, four were enriched under saline (0.0, 0.25, 0.5 and 1.0 mol NaCl l-1) and two under thermophilic conditions (65°C). Five communities enriched for HOB were subsequently cultivated in continuously stirred reactors under the same conditions to evaluate their potential as microbial protein producers. The protein percentages ranged from 41 to 80%. The highest protein content was obtained for the thermophilic enrichments. Amino acid profiles were comparable to protein sources commonly used for feed purposes. Members of the genus Achromobacter were found to dominate the saline enrichments while members of the genus Hydrogenibacillus were found to dominate the thermophilic enrichments. Here we show that enriching for HOB while steering the community toward low diversity and maintaining a high quality protein content can be successfully achieved, both in saline and thermophilic conditions.IMPORTANCE Alternative feed and food supply chains are required to decrease water and land use. HOB offer a promising substitute for traditional agricultural practice to produce microbial protein (MP) from residual materials and renewable energy. To safeguard product stability, the composition of the HOB community should be controlled. Defining strategies to maintain the stability of the communities is therefore key for optimization purposes. In this study, we use salt and temperature as independent conditions to stabilize the composition of the HOB communities. Based on the results presented, we conclude that HOB communities can be steered to have low diversity using the presented conditions while producing a desirable protein content with a valuable amino acid profile.\n",

      "We assessed changes in skeletal muscle energy metabolism by 31P-magnetic resonance spectroscopy (31P-MRS) and oxygen supply by near-infrared spectroscopy (NIR), after exercise and after administration of glucose and a branched-chain amino acids (BCAA), in healthy volunteers and patients with liver cirrhosis. As for the patients with liver cirrhosis, 4 were classified in Child-Pugh Grade A and the other 4 in Grade B. In patients with liver cirrhosis, the intramuscular pH and PCr index (PCr/PCr + Pi) were lower than in healthy subjects after exercise in the fasting state; the deltapH and deltaPCr index were statistically siginificant (p<0.05), indicating a disorder of aerobic metabolism. NIR revealed normality with oxygen supply and suggested a decreased oxygen utilization efficiency; that is, failure of the TCA cycle. The deltapH improved slightly after the administration of glucose alone, while it was definitely low (p<0.05) after co-administration of glucose and BCAA, which acts directly on the TCA cycle, indicating improvement of skeletal muscle energy metabolism.\n",

      " \n",
      "Nitrogenase converts N2 to NH3, at one face of an Fe-Mo-S cluster (FeMo-co) buried in the protein. Through exploration of cavities in the structures of nitrogenase proteins, a pathway for the egress of ammonia from its generation site to the external medium is proposed. This pathway is conserved in the three species Azotobacter vinelandii, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Clostridium pasteurianum. A molecular mechanism for the translocation of NH3 by skipping through a sequence of hydrogen bonds involving eleven water molecules and surrounding aminoacids has been developed. The putative mechanism requires movement aside of some water molecules by up to ~ 1Å. Consistent with this, the surrounding protein is comprised of different chains and has little secondary structure: protein fluctuations are part of the mechanism. This NH3 pathway is well separated from the water chain and embedded proton wire that have been proposed for serial supply of protons to FeMo-co. Verification procedures are suggested.\n",

Thus, hpm91 displays a higher capacity of H2 production than a previously characterized pgr5 mutant. Physiological and biochemical characterization of hpm91 reveal that the prolonged H2 production is due to enhanced stability of PSII, which correlates with increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging capacity during sulfur deprivation. This anti-ROS response appears to protect the photosynthetic electron transport chain from photo-oxidative damage and thereby ensures electron supply to the hydrogenase.\n",

      "Arginine (Arg) and methionine (Met) can elicit anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects in animals. Unlike Met, however, it is unknown if the supply of Arg can impact key aspects of adipose tissue (AT) function in dairy cows. Since Met and Arg metabolism are linked through the synthesis of polyamines, it is also possible that they have a complementary effect on aspects of AT function during a stress challenge. In this experiment, subcutaneous AT was harvested from four lactating multiparous Holstein cows (~27.0 kg milk per day, body condition score 3.38 ± 0.23) and used for incubations (4 h) with the following: control medium with an \"ideal\" profile of essential amino acids (IPAA; CTR; Lys:Met 2.9:1), IPAA plus 100 μM H2O2 (HP), H2O2 plus greater Arg supply (HPARG; Lys:Arg 1:1), or H2O2 plus greater Arg and methionine (Met) supply (HPARGMET; Lys:Met 2.5:1 and Lys:Arg 1:1). Western blotting was used to measure abundance of 18 protein targets associated with insulin and AA signaling, nutrient transport, inflammation, and antioxidant response. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to assess effects on genes associated with Arg metabolism. Among the protein targets measured, although abundance of phosphorylated (p) AKT serine/threonine kinase (P = 0.05) and p-mechanistic target of rapamycin (P = 0.04) were lowest in HP explants, this effect was attenuated in HPARG and especially HPARGMET compared with CTR. Compared with HP, incubation with HPARG led to upregulation of the AA transporter solute carrier family 1 member 3 (L-glutamate transporter; P = 0.03), the reactive oxygen species detoxification-related enzyme glutathione S-transferase mu 1 (GSTM1; P = 0.03), and fatty acid synthase (P = 0.05). Those effects were accompanied by greater abundance of solute carrier family 2 member 4 (insulin-induced glucose transporter) in explants incubated with HPARG and also HPARGMET (P = 0.04). In addition, compared with other treatments, the peak response in abundance of the intracellular energy sensor 5'-prime-AMP-activated protein kinase was detected with HPARGMET (P = 0.003). There was no effect of Arg or Arg plus Met on the mRNA abundance of genes associated with Arg metabolism (ARG1, NOS2, AMD1, SMS, and SRM). Overall, supplementation of Arg alone or with Met partially alleviated the negative effects induced by H2O2. More systematic studies need to be conducted to explore the function of Arg supply with or without Met on AT function.\n",

      "The uptake in Europe of Energy from Waste (EfW) incinerator plants has increased rapidly in recent years. In the UK, 25 municipal waste incinerators with energy recovery are now in operation; however, their waste supply chains and business practices vary significantly. With over a hundred more plant developments being considered it is important to establish best business practices for ensuring efficient environmental and operational performance. By reviewing the 25 plants we identify four suitable case study plants to compare technologies (moving grate, fluidised bed and rotary kiln), plant economics and operations. Using data collected from annual reports and through interviews and site visits we provide recommendations for improving the supply chain for waste incinerators and highlight the current issues and challenges faced by the industry. We find that plants using moving grate have a high availability of 87-92%. However, compared to the fluidised bed and rotary kiln, quantities of bottom ash and emissions of hydrogen chloride and carbon monoxide are high. The uptake of integrated recycling practices, combined heat and power, and post incineration non-ferrous metal collections needs to be increased among EfW incinerators in the UK. We conclude that one of the major difficulties encountered by waste facilities is the appropriate selection of technology, capacity, site, waste suppliers and heat consumers. This study will be of particular value to EfW plant developers, government authorities and researchers working within the sector of waste management.\n",

      "The hydrogen-oxidizing \"Knallgas\" bacterium Ralstonia eutropha can thrive in aerobic and anaerobic environments and readily switches between heterotrophic and autotrophic metabolism, making it an attractive host for biotechnological applications including the sustainable H2-driven production of hydrocarbons. The soluble hydrogenase (SH), one out of four different [NiFe]-hydrogenases in R. eutropha, mediates H2 oxidation even in the presence of O2, thus providing an ideal model system for biological hydrogen production and utilization. The SH reversibly couples H2 oxidation with the reduction of NAD+ to NADH, thereby enabling the sustainable regeneration of this biotechnologically important nicotinamide cofactor. Thus, understanding the interaction of the SH with the cellular NADH/NAD+ pool is of high interest. Here, we applied the fluorescent biosensor Frex to measure changes in cytoplasmic [NADH] in R. eutropha cells under different gas supply conditions. The results show that Frex is well-suited to distinguish SH-mediated changes in the cytoplasmic redox status from effects of general anaerobiosis of the respiratory chain. Upon H2 supply, the Frex reporter reveals a robust fluorescence response and allows for monitoring rapid changes in cellular [NADH]. Compared to the Peredox fluorescence reporter, Frex displays a diminished NADH affinity, which prevents the saturation of the sensor under typical bacterial [NADH] levels. Thus, Frex is a valuable reporter for on-line monitoring of the [NADH]/[NAD+] redox state in living cells of R. eutropha and other proteobacteria. Based on these results, strategies for a rational optimization of fluorescent NADH sensors are discussed.\n",

      "Hydrogen photoproduction by eukaryotic microalgae results from a connection between the photosynthetic electron transport chain and a plastidial hydrogenase. Algal H₂ production is a transitory phenomenon under most natural conditions, often viewed as a safety valve protecting the photosynthetic electron transport chain from overreduction. From the colony screening of an insertion mutant library of the unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii based on the analysis of dark-light chlorophyll fluorescence transients, we isolated a mutant impaired in cyclic electron flow around photosystem I (CEF) due to a defect in the Proton Gradient Regulation Like1 (PGRL1) protein. Under aerobiosis, nonphotochemical quenching of fluorescence (NPQ) is strongly decreased in pgrl1. Under anaerobiosis, H₂ photoproduction is strongly enhanced in the pgrl1 mutant, both during short-term and long-term measurements (in conditions of sulfur deprivation). Based on the light dependence of NPQ and hydrogen production, as well as on the enhanced hydrogen production observed in the wild-type strain in the presence of the uncoupling agent carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone, we conclude that the proton gradient generated by CEF provokes a strong inhibition of electron supply to the hydrogenase in the wild-type strain, which is released in the pgrl1 mutant. Regulation of the trans-thylakoidal proton gradient by monitoring pgrl1 expression opens new perspectives toward reprogramming the cellular metabolism of microalgae for enhanced H₂ production.\n",

      "The influence of variable energy demand on both the total ATP/ADP ratio and the rate of respiration was investigated in isolated hepatocytes. For hepatocytes respiring at the same rate, different ATP/ADP ratios were observed when the energy drain was caused either by ureogenesis and gluconeogenesis or by partial uncoupling. These differences were provoked by an additional effect of the precursors of syntheses studied, i.e. lactate or ornithine, on the hydrogen supply of the respiratory chain, as was reflected in terms of the reduction degree of cytochrome c in isolated mitochondria. For a fixed hydrogen supply there exists a defined characteristic ATP/ADP ratio versus rate of respiration. It is concluded that the respiratory rate, the mitochondrial redox state and the phosphorylation potential (transmitted into the extramitochondrial one by the adenine nucleotide translocator) represent a system of three interdependent parameters. The presence of metabolic precursors such as ornithine and lactate enhances the load of the cellular energy metabolism as well as the energy supply of the cell, the latter through improvement of substrate utilization. The ambivalent character of the precursors makes possible a kind of forward optimization of the hepatic energy metabolism which allows the cell to perform syntheses at a relatively high ATP/ADP ratio and, unless syntheses take place, to save energy by avoiding higher ATP/ADP ratios.\n",

Although the functions and structures of these molecules are quite diverse, the proton conducting pathways share a number of fundamental properties. Conceptual parallels include the translocation by hydrogen-bonded chain mechanisms, problems of supply and demand, equivalence of chemical and electrical proton gradients, proton wells, alternating access sites, pK(a) changes induced by protein conformational change, and heavy metal participation in proton transfer processes. An archetypal mechanism involves input and output proton pathways (hydrogen-bonded chains) joined by a regulatory site that switches the accessibility of the bound proton from one 'channel' to the other, by means of a pK(a) change, molecular movement, or both. Although little is known about the structure of voltage-gated proton channels, they appear to share many of these features. Evidently, nature has devised a limited number of mechanisms to accomplish various design strategies, and these fundamental mechanisms are repeated with minor variation in many superficially disparate molecules.\n",

In this study, we investigated whether nitrogen gas plasma, generated by applying a short high-voltage pulse to nitrogen using a static induction thyristor power supply (1.5 kilo pulse per second), exhibited a virucidal effect against adenoviruses. Viral titer was reduced by one log within 0.94 min. Results from detection of viral capsid proteins, hexon and penton, by Western blotting and immunochromatography were unaffected by the plasma treatment. In contrast, analysis using the polymerase chain reaction suggested that plasma treatment damages the viral genomic DNA. Reactive chemical products (hydrogen peroxide, nitrate, and nitrite), ultraviolet light (UV-A) and slight temperature elevations were observed during the operation of the gas plasma device. Viral titer versus intensity of each potential virucidal factor were used to identify the primary mechanism of disinfection of adenovirus. Although exposure to equivalent levels of UV-A or heat treatment did not inactivate adenovirus, treatment with a relatively low concentration of hydrogen peroxide efficiently inactivated the virus.

      "Electrical current can be used to supply reducing power to microbial metabolism. This phenomenon is typically studied in pure cultures with added redox mediators to transfer charge. Here, we investigate the development of a current-fed mixed microbial community fermenting glycerol at the cathode of a bioelectrochemical system in the absence of added mediators and identify correlations between microbial diversity and the respective product outcomes. Within 1 week of inoculation, a Citrobacter population represented 95 to 99% of the community and the metabolite profiles were dominated by 1,3-propanediol and ethanol. Over time, the Citrobacter population decreased in abundance while that of a Pectinatus population and the formation of propionate increased. After 6 weeks, several Clostridium populations and the production of valerate increased, which suggests that chain elongation was being performed. Current supply was stopped after 9 weeks and was associated with a decrease in glycerol degradation and alcohol formation. This decrease was reversed by resuming current supply; however, when hydrogen gas was bubbled through the reactor during open-circuit operation (open-circuit potential) as an alternative source of reducing power, glycerol degradation and metabolite production were unaffected. Cyclic voltammetry revealed that the community appeared to catalyze the hydrogen evolution reaction, leading to a +400-mV shift in its onset potential. Our results clearly demonstrate that current supply can alter fermentation profiles; however, further work is needed to determine the mechanisms behind this effect. In addition, operational conditions must be refined to gain greater control over community composition and metabolic outcomes.\n",

      " \n",
      "High-strength steel fasteners characterized by tensile strengths above 1100 MPa are often used in critical applications where a failure can have catastrophic consequences. Preventing hydrogen embrittlement (HE) failure is a fundamental concern implicating the entire fastener supply chain. Research is typically conducted under idealized conditions that cannot be translated into know-how prescribed in fastener industry standards and practices. Additionally, inconsistencies and even contradictions in fastener industry standards have led to much confusion and many preventable or misdiagnosed fastener failures. HE susceptibility is a function of the material condition, which is comprehensively described by the metallurgical and mechanical properties. Material strength has a first-order effect on HE susceptibility, which increases significantly above 1200 MPa and is characterized by a ductile--brittle transition. For a given concentration of hydrogen and at equal strength, the critical strength above which the ductile-brittle transition begins can vary due to second-order effects of chemistry, tempering temperature and sub-microstructure. Additionally, non-homogeneity of the metallurgical structure resulting from poorly controlled heat treatment, impurities and non-metallic inclusions can increase HE susceptibility of steel in ways that are measurable but unpredictable. Below 1200 MPa, non-conforming quality is often the root cause of real-life failures.This article is part of the themed issue 'The challenges of hydrogen and metals'.\n",

Although metal-organic frameworks have been extensively researched as adsorbents owing to their exceptional properties, lithium adsorption has been scarcely investigated. Herein, we prepared a novel cuboid rod-shaped three-dimensional framework termed TJU-21 composed of fluorine-pillared coordination layers of Fe-O inorganic chains and benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxylate (BTC) linkages. Besides thermal and chemical robustness, a remarkably high lithium uptake of about 41 mg·g-1 was observed on TJU-21 as a fast-spontaneous endothermic process. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction demonstrated that the adsorbed lithium was located in the cavity symmetrically assembled by iron sites and organic ligands between adjacent layers, while another kind of cavity in the framework circled by Fe-O-Fe-O-Fe-O-Fe chains and shared BTC linkages was occupied by hydrogen-bonded water molecules. Lithium adsorption resulted in decreased curviness of the coordination layers, and the binding energy change at O 1s as well as the increased Fe 2p peak, suggested potential interaction with iron sites. The practicability of TJU-21 as a lithium adsorbent was further proved by the considerable capacity and selectivity in simulated salt brines with excellent reusability.\n",

      "The cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp.PCC 6803 possesses a bidirectional NiFe-hydrogenase, HoxEFUYH. It functions to produce hydrogen under dark, fermentative conditions and photoproduces hydrogen when dark-adapted cells are illuminated. Unexpectedly, we found that the deletion of the large subunit of the hydrogenase (HoxH) in Synechocystis leads to an inability to grow on arginine and glucose under continuous light in the presence of oxygen. This is surprising, as the hydrogenase is an oxygen-sensitive enzyme. In wild-type (WT) cells, thylakoid membranes largely disappeared, cyanophycin accumulated, and the plastoquinone (PQ) pool was highly reduced, whereas ΔhoxH cells entered a dormant-like state and neither consumed glucose nor arginine at comparable rates to the WT. Hydrogen production was not traceable in the WT under these conditions. We tested and could show that the hydrogenase does not work as an oxidase on arginine and glucose but has an impact on the redox states of photosynthetic complexes in the presence of oxygen. It acts as an electron valve as an immediate response to the supply of arginine and glucose but supports the input of electrons from arginine and glucose oxidation into the photosynthetic electron chain in the long run, possibly via the NDH-1 complex. Despite the data presented in this study, the latter scenario requires further proof. The exact role of the hydrogenase in the presence of arginine and glucose remains unresolved. In addition, a unique feature of the hydrogenase is its ability to shift electrons between NAD(H), NADP(H), ferredoxin, and flavodoxin, which was recently shown in vitro and might be required for fine-tuning. Taken together, our data show that Synechocystis depends on the hydrogenase to metabolize organic carbon and nitrogen in the presence of oxygen, which might be an explanation for its prevalence in aerobic cyanobacteria.\n",

A method to overcome the gas-liquid transport resistance and to increase oxygen supply is by adding hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) to the fermentation system. Here we report that the H(2)O(2) not only can enhance the oxygen supply but also change the metabolism by inducing cytochrome P450, the key enzyme of a, o-oxidation. When C. tropicalis was cultivated in a 3-L bioreactor using the combination of aeration and H(2)O(2) feeding, DCA production rates increased by about 10% after a short period of decrease at the beginning. Furthermore, the experiments showed that the maximum activities of P450 could be induced at 2 mM H(2)O(2), and the inducible mechanisms are also discussed. Moreover, we suggest that alkane might be oxidized through the \"peroxide shunt pathway\" when H(2)O(2) is present. By adding H(2)O(2), the DCA yield in a 22-L bioreactor could increase by 25.3% and reach 153.9 g/L.\n",

      " \n",
      "Nitrogenase contains a well defined and conserved chain of water molecules leading to the FeMo cofactor (FeMo-co, an [Fe7MoCS9] cluster with bidentate chelation of Mo by homocitrate) that is the active site where N2 and other substrates are sequentially hydrogenated using multiple protons and electrons. The function of this chain is proposed to be a proton wire, serially translocating protons to triply-bridging S3B of FeMo-co, where, concomitant with electron transfer to FeMo-co, an H atom is generated on S3B. Density functional simulations of this proton translocation mechanism are reported here, using a large 269-atom model that includes all residues hydrogen bonded to and surrounding the water chain, and likely to influence proton transfer: three carboxylate O atoms of obligatory homocitrate are essential. The mechanism involves the standard two components of the Grotthuss mechanism, namely H atom slides that shift H3O(+) from one water site to the next, and HOH molecular rotations that convert backward (posterior) OH bonds in the water chain to forward (anterior) OH bonds. The topography of the potential energy surface for each of these steps has been mapped. H atom slides pass through very short (ca. 2.5 Å) O-H-O hydrogen bonds, while HOH rotations involve the breaking of O-HO hydrogen bonds, and the occurrence of long (up to 3.6 Å) separations between contiguous water molecules. Both steps involve low potential energy barriers, <7 kcal mol(-1). During operation of the Grotthuss mechanism in nitrogenase there are substantial displacements of water molecules along the chain, occurring as ripples. These characteristics of the 'Grotthuss two-step', coupled with a buffering ability of two carboxylate O atoms of homocitrate, and combined with density functional characterisation of the final proton slide from the ultimate water molecule to S3B (including electron addition), have been choreographed into a complete mechanism for serial hydrogenation of FeMo-co. The largest potential barrier is estimated to be 14 kcal mol(-1). These results are discussed in the context of reactivity data for nitrogenase, and the occurrence of a comparable water chain in cytochrome-c oxidase. Further investigation of the low-frequency conformational dynamics of the nitrogenase proteins, coupling proton transfer with other events in the nitrogenase cycle, is briefly canvassed.\n",

Refinement has confirmed that the copper co-ordination is best described as distorted trigonal planar, with strong in-plane bonds to His46 N delta 1, His117 N delta 1 and Cys112 S gamma, and much weaker axial interactions with Met121 S delta and Gly45 C = O. Two N-H...S hydrogen bonds characterize Cys112 S gamma as a thiolate (S-) sulphur and may influence the visible absorption maximum. Atoms in and around the copper site have very low mobility, whereas the most mobile regions of the molecule are the chain termini and some of the connecting loops between secondary structure elements, especially those at the \"southern\" end, remote from the copper site. Main-chain to side-chain hydrogen bonds supply important stabilizing interactions at the \"northern\" end. Surface features include the hydrophobic patch around His117, probably important for electron transfer, the SO2-4 site at His83, and the general absence of ion pairs, despite the presence of many charged amino acid residues. The 281 water molecules include 182 that occur as approximately twofold-related pairs. There are no internal water molecules. The water sites common to both azurin molecules include those in surface pockets and some in intermolecular contact regions. They are characterized by relatively low thermal parameters and numerous protein contacts.\n",

In both structures, the sorafenib molecule is in an extended conformation. The pyridine-2-carboxamide group exhibits a syn conformation of the N atoms in (I), whereas an almost anti orientation is present in (II). In both crystal structures, the two terminal groups, viz. pyridine-2-carboxamide and the trifluorophenyl ring, are oriented differently to the conformations found in enzyme-bound sorafenib. The sorafenib molecules in (I) are linked into zigzag chains by N-H···O hydrogen bonds, whereas in (II) the presence of the additional tosylate anion results in the formation of chains of fused hydrogen-bonded rings. This study reveals the variations in the solid-state conformation of the sorafenib molecule in different crystalline environments.\n",

      " \n",
      "To date acetate is the main product of microbial electrosynthesis (MES) from carbon dioxide (CO2). In this work a tubular bioelectrochemical system was used to carry out MES and enhance butyrate production over the other organic products. Batch tests were performed at a fixed cathode potential of -0.8V vs SHE. The reproducibility of the results according to previous experiments was validated in a preliminary test. According to the literature butyrate production could take place by chain elongation reactions at low pH and high hydrogen partial pressure (pH2). During the experiment, CO2 supply was limited to build up pH2 and trigger the production of compounds with a higher degree of reduction. In test 1 butyrate became the predominant end-product, with a concentration of 59.7mMC versus 20.3mMC of acetate, but limitation on CO2 supply resulted in low product titers. CO2 limitation was relaxed in test 2 to increase the bioelectrochemical activity but increase pH2 and promote the production of butyrate, what resulted in the production of 87.5mMC of butyrate and 34.7mMC of acetate. The consumption of ethanol, and the presence of other products in the biocathode (i.e. caproate) suggested that butyrate production took place through chain elongation reactions, likely driven by Megasphaera sueciensis (>39% relative abundance). Extraction and concentration of butyrate was performed by liquid membrane extraction. A concentration phase with 252.4mMC of butyrate was obtained, increasing also butyrate/acetate ratio to 16.4. The results are promising for further research on expanding the product portfolio of MES.\n",

      " \n",
      "Anaerobically adapted and illuminated Scenedesmus evolves molecular hydrogen from endogenous organic compounds. This photoproduction of H2 does not require photosystem II, since 5x10-6 M DCMU, which inhibited normal photosynthesis almost completely, did not significantly inhibit the photoevolution of H2. The relative efficiencies in far-red light of photosynthesis, photoreduction and H2 production were determined. Photohydrogen evolution was comparatively the most efficient of these three processes. Three mutants of Scenedesmus (isolated and characterized by Dr. N. I. Bishop) were also tested. Mutant PS-50, which lacks cytochrome 552, did not photoproduce H2. Mutant No. 11, blocked in photosystem II, showed rates of H2 production comparable to those of the wild type. Cl-CCP, an uncoupler of photophosphorylation, caused an apparent stimulation of H2 production by mutant No. 11 and wild-type cells. Mutant No. 8, which is partially blocked in photosystem I, showed a diminished photohydrogen production which was inhibited by Cl-CCP. These results suggest that photoproduction of hydrogen by photosystem I is due either to cyclic photophosphorylation, which supplies energy needed for a dark, H2-yielding reaction, or to a more direct photooxidation of organic compounds by the photosynthetic electron transfer chain.\n",

Quantitative polymerase chain reaction and enzyme‑linked immunosorbent assays further indicated that nitrogen gas plasma treatment for 15 min decreased the level of intact genomic DNA and increased the level of 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine, a major product of DNA oxidation. Three potential inactivation factors were generated during operation of the gas plasma instrument: Heat, longwave ultraviolet-A and oxidative stress (production of hydrogen peroxide, nitrite and nitrate). Treatment of the spores with hydrogen peroxide (3x2‑4%) effectively inactivated the bacteria, whereas heat treatment (100˚C), exposure to UV-A (75‑142 mJ/cm2) and 4.92 mM peroxynitrite (•ONOO‑), which is decomposed into nitrite and nitrate, did not. The results of the present study suggest the gas plasma treatment inactivates bacterial spores primarily by generating hydrogen peroxide, which contributes to the oxidation of the host genomic DNA.\n",

Shortage in these essential reagents is even more acute in developing countries with no means to produce kits locally. We sought to find an alternative procedure to replace commercial kits using common reagents found in molecular biology laboratories. Here we report a method for RNA extraction that takes about 40 min to complete ten samples, and is not more laborious than current commercial RNA extraction kits. We demonstrate that this method can be used to process nasopharyngeal swab samples and yields RT-qPCR results comparable to those obtained with commercial kits. Most importantly, this procedure can be easily implemented in any molecular diagnostic laboratory. Frequent testing is crucial for individual patient management as well as for public health decision making in this pandemic.

      " \n",
      "Mammalian Peptidoglycan Recognition Proteins (PGRPs) kill both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria through simultaneous induction of oxidative, thiol and metal stress responses in bacteria. However, metabolic pathways through which PGRPs induce these bactericidal stress responses are unknown. We screened Keio collection of Escherichia coli deletion mutants and revealed that deleting genes for respiratory chain flavoproteins or for tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle resulted in increased resistance of E. coli to PGRP killing. PGRP-induced killing depended on the production of hydrogen peroxide, which required increased supply of NADH for respiratory chain oxidoreductases from central carbon catabolism (glycolysis and TCA cycle), and was controlled by cAMP-Crp. Bactericidal PGRP induced a rapid decrease in respiration, which suggested that the main source of increased production of hydrogen peroxide was a block in respiratory chain and diversion of electrons from NADH oxidoreductases to oxygen. CpxRA two-component system was a negative regulator of PGRP-induced oxidative stress. By contrast, PGRP-induced thiol stress (depletion of thiols) and metal stress (increase in intracellular free Zn2+ through influx of extracellular Zn2+ ) were mostly independent of oxidative stress. Thus, manipulating pathways that induce oxidative, thiol and metal stress in bacteria could be a useful strategy to design new approaches to antibacterial therapy.\n",

In federal emergencies, reuse of PPE after disinfection can occur by processes, like vaporized hydrogen peroxide (VHP), recommended by the Centers for Disease and Control and Prevention. We identified a vacant animal holding facility at our institution to repurpose into a regional VHP decontamination center. The facility is a multiroom, 20 000 ft2 building with control of HVAC to adjust to VHP conditional requirements. H2O2 was delivered to rooms using robotic HaloFoggers, dispersing H2O2 vapor and increasingly concentrated microdroplets as a fog for a timed period based on cubic footage of rooms. Fogging cycles eliminated 6-log Geobacillus stearothermophilus up to 7 days postcycle. Functional efficacy of treated N95s was confirmed by fit tests of institutional personnel. Signage, process flow mapping, and training materials facilitated ease of workflow and adherence to safety expectations within the building. Our study determined that a variety of N95 respirator types and sizes were able to be cleared of potential bacterial and viral agents using VHP in a controlled fog/dwell/exhaust cycle. This repurposed animal facility has the capacity to decontaminate up to 6700 respirators daily, which will address the predicted surge of COVID-19 cases in the state, and ultimately allow each respirator to be reused multiple times.

      "10.1104/pp.109.144576\n",
      " \n",
      "Under sulfur deprivation conditions, the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii produces hydrogen in the light in a sustainable manner thanks to the contribution of two pathways, direct and indirect. In the direct pathway, photosystem II (PSII) supplies electrons to hydrogenase through the photosynthetic electron transport chain, while in the indirect pathway, hydrogen is produced in the absence of PSII through a photosystem I-dependent process. Starch metabolism has been proposed to contribute to both pathways by feeding respiration and maintaining anoxia during the direct pathway and by supplying reductants to the plastoquinone pool during the indirect pathway. At variance with this scheme, we report that a mutant lacking starch (defective for sta6) produces similar hydrogen amounts as the parental strain in conditions of sulfur deprivation. However, when PSII is inhibited by 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea, conditions where hydrogen is produced by the indirect pathway, hydrogen production is strongly reduced in the starch-deficient mutant. We conclude that starch breakdown contributes to the indirect pathway by feeding electrons to the plastoquinone pool but is dispensable for operation of the direct pathway that prevails in the absence of DCMU. While hydrogenase induction was strongly impaired in the starch-deficient mutant under dark anaerobic conditions, wild-type-like induction was observed in the light. Because this light-driven hydrogenase induction is DCMU insensitive and strongly inhibited by carbonyl cyanide-p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone or 2,5-dibromo-3-methyl-6-isopropyl-p-benzoquinone, we conclude that this process is regulated by the proton gradient generated by cyclic electron flow around PSI.\n",

      " \n",
      "Future ocean acidification (OA) will affect physiological traits of marine species, with calcifying species being particularly vulnerable. As OA entails high energy demands, particularly during the rapid juvenile growth phase, food supply may play a key role in the response of marine organisms to OA. We experimentally evaluated the role of food supply in modulating physiological responses and biomineralization processes in juveniles of the Chilean scallop, Argopecten purpuratus, that were exposed to control (pH ~ 8.0) and low pH (pH ~ 7.6) conditions using three food supply treatments (high, intermediate, and low). We found that pH and food levels had additive effects on the physiological response of the juvenile scallops. Metabolic rates, shell growth, net calcification, and ingestion rates increased significantly at low pH conditions, independent of food. These physiological responses increased significantly in organisms exposed to intermediate and high levels of food supply. Hence, food supply seems to play a major role modulating organismal response by providing the energetic means to bolster the physiological response of OA stress. On the contrary, the relative expression of chitin synthase, a functional molecule for biomineralization, increased significantly in scallops exposed to low food supply and low pH, which resulted in a thicker periostracum enriched with chitin polysaccharides. Under reduced food and low pH conditions, the adaptive organismal response was to trade-off growth for the expression of biomineralization molecules and altering of the organic composition of shell periostracum, suggesting that the future performance of these calcifiers will depend on the trajectories of both OA and food supply. Thus, incorporating a suite of traits and multiple stressors in future studies of the adaptive organismal response may provide key insights on OA impacts on marine calcifiers.\n",

We showed that the relationships between either delta p or charge/O ratio and respiratory rate are different under the two kinds of steady state, indicating different degrees of intrinsic uncoupling in respiratory chain. Moreover, we observed a non-ohmic dependence between H(+)-conductance and delta p.

      " \n",
      "Haber-Bosch (HB) process, the main method for ammonia (NH3) production, contributes to near 2% of the global carbon emissions because the hydrogen input is obtained from fossil sources. NH3 production is concentrated in a few countries, adding emissions due to global distribution. Distributed plants next to farmers and fed by renewable energy can reduce these impacts, as well as NH3 storage, shortage risks, and price volatility. Distributed plants cannot reach low NH3 production costs as centralised plants, but they can be promoted by the environmental benefits of its products lifecycles. Therefore, life cycle assessments of NH3 production pathways and specific modelling for NH3 transport in Australia were performed, from cradle-to-site, to identify the influence of storage, transport, and energy sources in their environmental profiles. The carbon footprint of centralised production was up to 2.96 kg.CO2-eq/kg.NH3, from which 29.3% corresponded to transport. Local production demonstrated substantial avoided transport impacts and that CO2-eq can reach reductions over 100% when including co-product credits such as oxygen and carbon black. Local plants using electrolysers to supply mini-HB loops obtained rates of 0.12, -0.52, and -1.57 kg.CO2-eq/kg.NH3 using electricity from solar, wind, and biogas (other than manure) sources, respectively. The alternative using high temperature plasma reactor instead of electrolyser obtained its best rate of -0.65 kg.CO2-eq/kg using biogas different from manure. At farm electrolyser-based plants using novel non-thermal plasma reactors, considering potential energy yields and simplified NH3 separation technology, could reach a rate of -1.07 kg.CO2-eq/kg.NH3, using solar energy. Among the assessed pathways, the most notable impact was on freshwater eutrophication in the electrolyser-based plants generating reductions up to 290%, due to oxygen credits. Despite these results, the use of solar energy raises concerns on land use and terrestrial ecotoxicity due to the area needed for solar farms and the manufacture of their components.\n",

      "A continuous supply of radical species is a key requirement for activating chain growth and accessing quantitative monomer conversions in reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization. In Fenton-RAFT, activation is provided by hydroxyl radicals, whose indiscriminate reactivity and short-lived nature poses a challenge to accessing extended polymerization times and quantitative monomer conversions. Here, an alternative Fenton-RAFT procedure is presented, whereby radical generation can be finely controlled via metered dosing of a component of the Fenton redox reaction (H2 O2 ) using an external pumping system. By limiting the instantaneous flux of radicals and ensuring sustained radical generation over tunable time periods, metered reagent addition reduces unwanted radical \"wasting\" reactions and provides access to consistent quantitative monomer conversions with high chain-end fidelity. Fine tuning of radical concentration during polymerization is achieved simply via adjustment of reagent dose rate, offering significant potential for automation. This modular strategy holds promise for extending traditional RAFT initiation toward more tightly regulated radical concentration profiles and affords excellent prospects for the automation of Fenton-RAFT polymerization.\n",

However, its interaction with the photosynthetic electron transport chain remains unclear. By GFP-tagging the HoxF diaphorase subunit we show that the hydrogenase is thylakoid associated, comprising a population dispersed uniformly through the thylakoids and a subpopulation localized to discrete puncta in the distal thylakoid. Thylakoid localisation of both the HoxH and HoxY hydrogenase subunits is confirmed by immunogold electron microscopy. The diaphorase HoxE subunit is essential for recruitment to the dispersed thylakoid population, potentially anchoring the hydrogenase to the membrane, but aggregation to puncta occurs through a distinct HoxE-independent mechanism. Membrane association does not require NDH-1. Localization is dynamic on a scale of minutes, with anoxia and high light inducing a significant redistribution between these populations in favour of puncta. Since HoxE is essential for access to its electron donor, electron supply to the hydrogenase depends on a physiologically controlled localization, potentially offering a new avenue to enhance photosynthetic hydrogen production by exploiting localization/aggregation signals.\n",

Further, a silver nanowire (AgNW) network combined with the polymer binder supplies an effective three-dimensional (3D) electrical path, sufficient void space to buffer the volume changes, and highly adhesive interaction with the current collector.

      "The gill of the protobranch clam Solemya reidi houses a dense population of intracellular symbiotic chemoautotrophic sulfur-oxidizing bacteria that fix carbon dioxide into sugars and supply the carbon nutrition of the host. The gill is divided into a bacteriocyte (cells with intracellular symbionts) domain and a domain of mitochondria-rich, symbiont-free ciliated cells. Optical spectra, recorded separately from each domain, are dominated by hemoglobin. Only oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin were detected in the gill. In sharp contrast to the gill of the congener Solemya velum, ferric hemoglobin sulfide was not detected, suggesting that this species, if formed, is short lived. The spectral contribution of hemoglobin may be cancelled or subtracted in difference spectra. Difference spectra of each gill domain in nitrogen minus the same tissue in air show a complement of reduced cytochromes, demonstrating that both symbiont and mitochondrial cytochromes are reduced by endogenous substrate. Difference spectra of the bacteriocyte domain exposed to hydrogen sulfide (air containing 1.4 torr hydrogen sulfide minus air) show only the contribution of reduced symbiont cytochrome c552. The extent of reduction increases monotonically with ambient pH2S, suggesting that, by analogy with some free-living sulfur-oxidizing bacteria, cytochrome c552 is near the point of entry of electrons into the symbiont electron transport chain. Difference spectra of muscle or of the ciliated domain under these same conditions show reduced cytochrome c550, cytochrome b and cytochrome oxidase, suggesting that host mitochondria may accept electrons from hydrogen sulfide.\n",

      "In incubations with isolated rat liver mitochondria we studied the fuel properties of octanoate as medium-chain fatty acid and respiratory substrate and the extent of control exerted by adenine nucleotide translocase on mitochondrial respiration. While, compared with pyruvate, octanoate improved the hydrogen supply in the active state to be seen from a high reduction of the mitochondrial NAD(P) system and an increased delta psi, it also decreased the efficiency of energy transduction indicated by a low ADP/O ratio. Based on measurements of the dependence of respiration on the extramitochondrial ATP/ADP ratio, we conclude that a switch-over from pyruvate to fatty acid oxidation does not change the kinetic parameters which make respiration respond to the ATP/ADP ratio. It is shown that the decrease of the exchangeable intramitochondrial adenine nucleotide pool due to the activation of octanoate results in a decrease of the activity of the adenine nucleotide translocase and an increase of its flux control coefficient.\n",

The pTB nanotube has a length of ∼40 Å that spans the membrane and a uniform inner diameter of 4 Å that holds a single-file water-chain. Single-channel proton currents were measured using planar lipid bilayers in various proton concentrations and membrane potentials (±400 mV). We found, surprisingly, that the current-voltage curves were asymmetric with symmetric proton concentrations in both solutions across the membrane (rectification). The proton flux from the C-terminal to the N-terminal end was 1.6 times higher than that from the opposite. At lower proton concentrations, the degree of rectification was attenuated, but with the addition of a pH-buffer (dichloroacetate) that supplies protons near the entrance, the rectification emerged. These results indicate that the permeation processes inside the pore generate the rectification, which is masked at low concentrations by the diffusion-limited access of protons to the pore entrance. The permeation processes were characterized by a discrete-state Markov model, in which hops of a proton followed by water-chain turnovers were implemented. The optimized model revealed that the water-chain turnover exhibited unusual voltage dependence, and the distinct voltage-dependencies of the forward and backward transition rates yielded the rectification. The pTB nanotube serves as a rectified proton conductor, and the design principles can be exploited for proton-conducting materials.\n",

      "Prostaglandin H synthase (PGHS) catalyzes the biosynthesis of PGG2 and PGH2, the precursor of all prostanoids, from arachidonic acid (AA). PGHS exhibits two enzymatic activities following a branched-chain radical mechanism: 1) a peroxidase activity (POX) that utilizes hydroperoxide through heme redox cycles to generate the critical Tyr385 tyrosyl radical for coupling both enzyme activities; 2) the cyclooxygenase (COX) activity inserting two oxygen molecules into AA to generate endoperoxide/hydroperoxide PGG2 through a series of radical intermediates. Upon the generation of Tyr385 radical, COX catalysis is initiated, with C13 pro-S hydrogen abstraction from AA by Tyr385 radical to generate arachidonyl substrate radical. Oxygen provides a large driving force for the subsequent fast steps leading to the formation of PGG2, including radical redistributions, ring formations, and rearrangements. On the other hand, if the supply of oxygen is severed, equilibrium between arachidonyl radical and tyrosyl radical(s) biases largely towards the latter. In this study, we demonstrate that such equilibrium is shifted by many factors, including temperature, chemical structures of fatty acid substrates and limited supply of oxygen. We also, for the first time, reveal that this equilibrium is significantly affected by co-substrates of POX. The presence of efficient POX co-substrates, which reduces heme to its ferric state, apparently biases the equilibrium towards arachidonyl radical. Therefore a dynamic interplay exists between the two activities of PGHS.\n",

      " \n",
      "Chemodynamic therapy (CDT), an emerging therapeutic strategy, has been recently exploited for in situ treatment through Fenton or Fenton-like reactions to generate cytotoxic reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, current systems rely significantly on the high local oxygen levels and strongly acidic conditions (pH = 3.0-5.0). Simultaneously, the produced ROS can be rapidly consumed by intracellular glutathione (GSH) in the electron transport chain. Herein, an original and biomimetic CoO@AuPt nanocatalyst was prepared based on the assembly of Au and Pt nanoparticles (NPs) on the surface of hollow CoO nanocapsules. The as-synthesized nanozyme exhibits extremely high stability under physiological conditions, whereas it undergoes spontaneous disintegration in the unique tumor microenvironment (TME). Subsequently, the decomposition products can catalyze a cascade of biochemical reactions to produce abundant ROS without any external stimuli. Thus, the present nanoplatform can increase intracellular ROS levels through continuous supply of H2O2, relief of local hypoxia and depletion of GSH, which result in remarkable and specific tumor damage both in vitro and in vivo. The findings of this study highlight the promising potential of CoO@AuPt nanocatalyst as a TME-responsive CDT nanomagnet for highly efficient tumor therapy.\n",

      "10.1038/nplants.2017.41\n",
      " \n",
      "Sunlight is absorbed and converted to chemical energy by photosynthetic organisms. At the heart of this process is the most fundamental reaction on Earth, the light-driven splitting of water into its elemental constituents. In this way molecular oxygen is released, maintaining an aerobic atmosphere and creating the ozone layer. The hydrogen that is released is used to convert carbon dioxide into the organic molecules that constitute life and were the origin of fossil fuels. Oxidation of these organic molecules, either by respiration or combustion, leads to the recombination of the stored hydrogen with oxygen, releasing energy and reforming water. This water splitting is achieved by the enzyme photosystem II (PSII). Its appearance at least 3 billion years ago, and linkage through an electron transfer chain to photosystem I, directly led to the emergence of eukaryotic and multicellular organisms. Before this, biological organisms had been dependent on hydrogen/electron donors, such as H2S, NH3, organic acids and Fe2+, that were in limited supply compared with the oceans of liquid water. However, it is likely that water was also used as a hydrogen source before the emergence of PSII, as found today in anaerobic prokaryotic organisms that use carbon monoxide as an energy source to split water. The enzyme that catalyses this reaction is carbon monoxide dehydrogenase (CODH). Similarities between PSII and the iron- and nickel-containing form of this enzyme (Fe-Ni CODH) suggest a possible mechanism for the photosynthetic O–O bond formation.\n",

      "In order to prolong the effect of CaO2 on improvement of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) production in sludge anaerobic fermentation, CaO2 particles were successfully loaded onto the porous surface of steel slag pre-modified with salicylic acid-methanol (SAM-SS). The prepared CaO2/SAM-SS was then characterized and investigated for its effects on anaerobic fermentation. Experimental results revealed that, due to the slow release and reaction of CaO2/SAM-SS, SCFAs concentrations in CaO2/SAM-SS tests were significantly higher than in the control and SAM-SS tests, and high SCFAs concentration was sustained for a longer period than in the CaO2 tests. Since most bacterial indexes were reduced by CaO2/SAM-SS, more supply of \"raw materials\" from a better disintegration and hydrolysis, which was associated with the alkalinity and •OH radicals released from the reaction of CaO2 with H2O, contribute to the higher SCFAs yields. This study provides a new approach towards a higher and longer SCFAs harvesting.\n",

However, this paper, in which we investigate autoxidizing methyl linoleate, presents decisive evidence against such an assumption: Autoxidation-accelerating activity under mild conditions was not found in the chromatographically separated main-product hydroperoxide fraction but was found in other fractions; and highly active substances with structures containing a peroxide-linked dimer with two hydroperoxy groups were actually obtained.\n",

      "The stability of (all-E)-β-carotene toward dietary iron was studied in a mildly acidic (pH 4) micellar solution as a simple model of the postprandial gastric conditions. The oxidation was initiated by free iron (Fe(II), Fe(III)) or by heme iron (metmyoglobin, MbFe(III)). Fe(II) and metmyoglobin were much more efficient than Fe(III) at initiating β-carotene oxidation. Whatever the initiator, hydrogen peroxide did not accumulate. Moreover, β-carotene markedly inhibited the conversion of Fe(II) into Fe(III). β-Carotene oxidation induced by Fe(II) or MbFe(III) was maximal with 5-10 eq Fe(II) or 0.05-0.1 eq MbFe(III) and was inhibited at higher iron concentrations, especially with Fe(II). UPLC/DAD/MS and GC/MS analyses revealed a complex distribution of β-carotene-derived products including Z-isomers, epoxides, and cleavage products of various chain lengths. Finally, the mechanism of iron-induced β-carotene oxidation is discussed. Altogether, our results suggest that dietary iron, especially free (loosely bound) Fe(II) and heme iron, may efficiently induce β-carotene autoxidation within the upper digestive tract, thereby limiting its supply to tissues (bioavailability) and consequently its biological activity.\n",

      " \n",
      "Anaerobic digestion (AD) is an important technology for the effective conversion of waste and wastewater to methane. Here, syntrophic bacteria transfer molecular hydrogen (H2 ), formate, or directly supply electrons (direct interspecies electron transfer, DIET) to the methanogens. Evidence is accumulating that the methanation of short-chain fatty acids can be enhanced by the addition of conductive material to the anaerobic digester, which has often been attributed to the stimulation of DIET. Since little is known about the transcriptional response of a complex AD microbial community to the addition of conductive material, we added magnetite to propionate-fed laboratory-scale reactors that were inoculated with wastewater sludge. Compared to the control reactors, the magnetite-amended reactors showed improved methanation of propionate. A genome-centric metatranscriptomics approach identified the active SCFA-oxidizing bacteria that affiliated with Firmicutes, Desulfobacterota and Cloacimonadota. The transcriptional profiles revealed that the syntrophic bacteria transferred acetate, H2 and formate to acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogens, whereas transcription of potential determinants for DIET such as conductive pili and outer-membrane cytochromes did not significantly change with magnetite addition. Overall, changes in the transcriptional profiles of syntrophic Bacteria and Archaea in propionate-fed lab-scale reactors amended with magnetite refute a major role of DIET in the studied system.\n",

      " \n",
      "The Na(+)-H+ antiport is a membrane-bound glycoprotein that extrudes intracellular acid loads and regulates cellular volume. Cellular synthesis of the oligosaccharide side chains of glycoproteins is dependent on a supply of mevalonate, itself a product of the rate-limiting enzyme of cholesterol synthesis 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase. The effect of two HMG CoA reductase inhibitors (simvastatin and 25-hydroxycholesterol) on intracellular pH and Na(+)-H+ exchange was therefore studied. Inhibition of the Na(+)-H+ antiport by these agents led to a fall in intracellular pH but did not impair the regulatory volume increase response to a hypertonic stimulus. The inhibitory effect of simvastatin was prevented by mevalonate but not dolichol or squalene. The effect of 25-hydroxycholesterol was more complex and not easily reversed. Thus HMG CoA reductase inhibitors reduced the ability of human lymphoblasts to expel an intracellular acid load via the Na(+)-H+ antiport, although the response of the antiport to an osmotic stimulus was preserved.\n",

      "Cadmium (Cd) is a trace element causing severe toxicity symptoms in plants, besides posing hazardous fitness issue due to its buildup in the human body through food chain. Nanoparticles (NPs) are recently employed as a novel strategy to directly ameliorate the Cd stress and acted as nano-fertilizers. The intend of the current study was to explore the effects of zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO-NPs; 50 mg/L) on plant growth, photosynthetic activity, elemental status and antioxidant activity in Oryza sativa (rice) under Cd (0.8 mM) stress. To this end, the rice plants are treated by Cd stress at 15 days after sowing (DAS), and the treatment was given directly into the soil. Supply of ZnO-NPs as foliar spray was given for five consecutive days from 30 to 35 DAS, and sampling was done at 45 DAS. However, rice plants supplemented with ZnO-NPs under the Cd toxicity revealed significantly increased shoot length (SL; 34.0%), root fresh weight (RFW; 30.0%), shoot dry weight (SDW; 23.07%), and root dry weight (RDW; 12.24%). Moreover, the ZnO-NPs supplement has also positive effects on photosynthesis related parameters, SPAD value (40%), chloroplast structure, and qualitatively high fluorescence observed by confocal microscopy even under Cd stress. ZnO-NPs also substantially prevented the increases of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and malondialdehyde (MDA) triggered by Cd. Physiological and biochemical analysis showed that ZnO-NPs increased enzymatic activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD; 59%), catalase (CAT; 52%), and proline (17%) that metabolize reactive oxygen species (ROS); these increases coincided with the changes observed in the H2O2 and MDA accumulation after ZnO-NPs application. In conclusion, ZnO-NPs application to foliage has great efficiency to improve biomass, photosynthesis, protein, antioxidant enzymes activity, mineral nutrient contents and reducing Cd levels in rice. This can be attributed mainly from reduced oxidative damage resulted due to the ZnO-NPs application.\n",

      "10.1139/cjpp-2019-0281\n",
      " \n",
      "Mitochondria are the major source of cellular energy metabolism. In the cardiac cells, mitochondria produce by way of the oxidative phosphorylation more than 90% of the energy supply in the form of ATP, which is utilized in many ATP-dependent processes, like cycling of the contractile proteins or maintaining ion gradients. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are by-products of cellular metabolism and their levels are controlled by intracellular antioxidant systems. Imbalance between ROS and the antioxidant defense leads to oxidative stress and oxidative changes to cellular biomolecules. Molecular hydrogen (H2) has been proved as beneficial in the prevention and therapy of various diseases including cardiovascular disorders. It selectively scavenges hydroxyl radical and peroxynitrite, reduces oxidative stress, and has anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects. The effect of H2 on the myocardial mitochondrial function and coenzyme Q levels is not well known. In this paper, we demonstrated that consumption of H2-rich water (HRW) resulted in stimulated rat cardiac mitochondrial electron respiratory chain function and increased levels of ATP production by Complex I and Complex II substrates. Similarly, coenzyme Q9 levels in the rat plasma, myocardial tissue, and mitochondria were increased and malondialdehyde level in plasma was reduced after HRW administration. Based on obtained data, we hypothesize a new metabolic pathway of the H2 effect in mitochondria on the Q-cycle and in mitochondrial respiratory chain function. The Q-cycle contains three coenzyme Q forms: coenzyme Q in oxidized form (ubiquinone), radical form (semiquinone), or reduced form (ubiquinol). H2 may be a donor of both electron and proton in the Q-cycle and thus we can suppose stimulation of coenzyme Q production. When ubiquinone is reduced to ubiquinol, lipid peroxidation is reduced. Increased CoQ9 concentration can stimulate electron transport from Complex I and Complex II to Complex III and increase ATP production via mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. Our results indicate that H2 may function to prevent/treat disease states with disrupted myocardial mitochondrial function.\n",

      "Commercial and military aviation is faced with challenges that include high fuel costs, undesirable emissions, and supply chain insecurity that result from the reliance on petroleum-based feedstocks. The development of alternative gas turbine fuels from renewable resources will likely be part of addressing these issues. The United States has established a target for one billion gallons of renewable fuels to enter the supply chain by 2018. These alternative fuels will have to be very similar in properties, chemistry, and composition to existing fuels. To further this goal, the National Jet Fuel Combustion Program (a collaboration of multiple U.S. agencies under the auspices of the Federal Aviation Administration, FAA) is coordinating measurements on three reference gas turbine fuels to be used as a basis of comparison. These fuels are reference fuels with certain properties that are at the limits of experience. These fuels include a low viscosity, low flash point, high hydrogen content \"best case\" JP-8 (POSF 10264) fuel, a relatively high viscosity, high flash point, low hydrogen content \"worst case\" JP-5 (POSF 10259) fuel, and a Jet-A (POSF 10325) fuel with relatively average properties. A comprehensive speciation of these fuels is provided in this paper by use of high resolution gas chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight - mass spectrometry (GC/QToF-MS), which affords unprecedented resolution and exact molecular formula capabilities. The volatility information as derived from the measurement of the advanced distillation curve temperatures, Tk and Th, provides an approximation of the vapor liquid equilibrium and examination of the composition channels provides detailed insight into thermochemical data. A comprehensive understanding of the compositional and thermophysical data of gas turbine fuels is required not only for comparison but also for modeling of such complex mixtures, which will, in turn, aid in the development of new fuels with the goals of diversified feedstocks, decreased pollution, and increased efficiency.\n",

      "Cyanotoxins are potent toxic compounds produced by cyanobacteria during algal blooms, which threaten drinking water supplies. These compounds can poison and kill animals and humans. The host-guest interactions of α-, β-, and γ-cyclodextrins (CD) with problematic cyanotoxins, including microcystins (MCs) and nodularin (NOD), were investigated to demonstrate the potential application of CDs for the removal of these toxins from drinking water or applications related to their separation or purification. MCs and NOD have a hydrophobic Adda chain, which contains diene and benzene functional groups. The complexation of these cyanotoxins with CDs was monitored by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). The (1)H NMR spectra for MCs are unchanged upon addition of α-CD (smallest host). However, addition of larger hosts, β-CD and γ-CD, leads to significant changes in chemical shifts of the benzene and diene resonances on the 3-amino-9-methoxy-2,6,8-trimethal-10-phenyldeca-4,6-dienoic acid (Adda) chain of MCs and NOD. Solution pH, natural organic matter, and salinity do not appreciably influence the host-guest complexation under our experimental conditions. The experimental binding constants for MCs and NOD with γ-CD are relatively strong, ranging from 1155 to 507 M(-1). The observed changes in chemical shifts for specific protons and competitive binding experiments demonstrate a 1:1 inclusion complex between γ-CD and MCs or NOD, with the Adda chains threading through the CD ring, resulting in an inclusion complex. Our results suggest that CD-type substrates are useful hosts for the complexation of MCs and NOD. CDs can be readily attached to a number of polymeric or solid supports and their functionality tailored to strengthen specific host-guest interactions. With further development of such materials, CD host-guest chemistry may find direct application in the removal and/or separation science of these compounds.\n",

      "1. H2O2 formation associated with the metabolism of added fatty acids was quantitatively determined in isolated haemoglobin-free perfused rat liver (non-recirculating system) by two different methods. 2. Organ spectrophotometry of catalase Compound I [Sies & Chance (1970) FEBS Lett. 11, 172-176] was used to detect H2O2 formation (a) by steady-state titration with added hydrogen donor, methanol or (b) by comparison of fatty-acid responses with those of the calibration compound, urate. 3. In the use of the peroxidatic reaction of catalase, [14C]methanol was added as hydrogen donor at an optimal concentration of 1 mM in the presence of 0.2 mM-L-methionine, and 14CO2 production rates were determined. 4. Results obtained by the different methods were similar. 5. The yield of H2O2 formation, expressed as the rate of H2O2 formation in relation to the rate of fatty-acid supply, was less than 1.0 in all cases, indicating that, regardless of chain length, less than one acetyl unit was formed per mol of added fatty acid by the peroxisomal system. In particular, the standard substrate used with isolated peroxisomal preparations (C16:0 fatty acid) gave low yield (close to zero). Long-chain monounsaturated fatty acids exhibit a relatively high yield of H2O2 formation. 6. The hypolipidaemic agent bezafibrate led to slightly increased yields for most of the acids tested, but the yield with oleate was decreased to one-half the original yield. 7. It is concluded that in the intact isolated perfused rat liver the assayable capacity for peroxisomal beta-oxidation is used to only a minor degree. However, the observed rates of H2O2 production with fatty acids can account for a considerable share of the endogenous H2O2 production found in the intact animal.\n",

      "Citrin deficiency is a hereditary disorder caused by SLC25A13 mutations and manifests as neonatal intrahepatic cholestasis (NICCD), failure to thrive and dyslipidemia (FTTDCD), and adult-onset type II citrullinemia (CTLN2). Citrin is a component of the malate-aspartate nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide hydrogen (NADH) shuttle, an essential shuttle for hepatic glycolysis. Hepatic glycolysis and the coupled lipogenesis are impaired in citrin deficiency. Hepatic lipogenesis plays a significant role in fat supply during growth spurt periods: the fetal period, infancy, and puberty. Growth impairment in these periods is characteristic of citrin deficiency. Hepatocytes with citrin deficiency cannot use glucose and fatty acids as energy sources due to defects in the NADH shuttle and downregulation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα), respectively. An energy deficit in hepatocytes is considered a fundamental pathogenesis of citrin deficiency. Medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) supplementation with a lactose-restricted formula and MCT supplementation under a low-carbohydrate diet are recommended for NICCD and CTLN2, respectively. MCT supplementation therapy can provide energy to hepatocytes, promote lipogenesis, correct the cytosolic NAD+ /NADH ratio via the malate-citrate shuttle and improve ammonia detoxification, and it is a reasonable therapy for citrin deficiency. It is very important to administer MCT at a dose equivalent to the liver's energy requirements in divided doses with meals. MCT supplementation therapy is certainly promising for promoting growth spurts during infancy and adolescence and for preventing CTLN2 onset. Intravenous administration of solutions containing fructose is contraindicated, and persistent hyperglycemia should be avoided due to glucose intoxication for patients receiving hyperalimentation or with complicating diabetes.\n",

      "We report the synthesis of amphiphilic dodecenyl phosphonic acid PC12 from vinylphosphonic acid, a reactive phosphonic acid intermediate. The trans-P-C=C moiety enabled PC12 to disperse well in water. Surface tension and dynamic light scattering measurements revealed that PC12 exhibited high surface activity and reduced the surface tension of water from 72.0 to 23.6 mN/m, thereby resulting in the spontaneous formation of aggregates even in a dilute aqueous solution (critical aggregation concentration (CAC) = 4.8 × 10-4 M). In contrast to modern lipids with double-tailed structures, the PC12 of simple singletailed structure spontaneously formed bilayered vesicles, without an external energy supply. Compared with the strength of hydrogen bonds formed by the long, saturated alkyl chain of dodecyl phosphonic acid (DPA), the strength of PC12 intermolecular hydrogen bonds was weaker. The melting point of PC12 was approximately 20°C lower than that of DPA. These results indicate that the trans-P-C=C moiety was considerably important for spontaneous vesicle formation in water. Preliminary modeling of the morphological transitions of the closed bilayer structures in the vesicles was then conducted, by varying the pH and adding an α-helical peptide scaffold.\n",

      "RATIONALE: Cotton is the most commonly used natural plant product for the manufacture of yarns and textiles. Consumer perception regarding differences in textile quality in relation to geographic provenance of cotton as well as stringent product labelling requirements demand for the supply chain to furnish proof of geographic provenance beyond merely paper-based audit trails. METHODS: We have applied isotope ratio mass spectrometry to generate multivariate data sets of raw cotton. A two-point equilibration process with water at ambient temperature was used to account for hydrogen exchange between free hydroxyl groups in the cellulose lattice at ambient humidity, prior to hydrogen isotope analysis. RESULTS: The molar fraction of exchangeable hydrogen in cotton at ambient temperature was found to be 0.046, which is in good agreement with the expected exchange fraction of 0.05. Hierarchical cluster analysis of multivariate stable isotope abundance data from 17 US cotton and 15 non-US cotton samples was able to cluster 15 of the 17 US cotton samples in one group. CONCLUSIONS: Hierarchical cluster analysis of multivariate stable isotope signatures of raw cotton showed great promise as an analytical tool to differentiate between US and non-US cotton and possibly even to be able to group unprocessed cotton according to geographic origin.\n",

Leaf area and biomass accumulation were significantly reduced at higher Cr supply. Generation of superoxide, hydrogen peroxide, and ·OH radical generation was enhanced in the chloroplasts isolated from Cr-exposed pea plants. Cr(VI) significantly reduced Fv/Fm ratio of chlorophyll (Chl) fluorescence, Chl content, and whole chain electron transport rate. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity increased at lower Cr supply while it decreased at higher Cr supply. Ascorbate peroxidase (APX) was found to be most sensitive to Cr stress. Monodehydroascorbate reductase activity remained higher at 20 and 50 µM Cr but decreased at 100 µM Cr. Increased activities of dehydroascorbate reductase (DHAR) and glutathione reductase (GR) in the isolated chloroplasts were observed during the initial 3 days of Cr exposure of pea plants. Activities of DHAR and GR were increased up to day 3 only. Ascorbate and glutathione (GSH) pools showed similar decrease that was more evident in the GSH pool as the duration of Cr treatment increased. Observed changes in reactive oxygen species concentration, photosynthetic characteristics, and antioxidant system indicate that chloroplasts in Cr-exposed pea plants are an important target of oxidative stress.\n",

      " \n",
      "Rare-earth elements, which include the lanthanide series, are key components of many clean energy technologies, including wind turbines and photovoltaics. Because most of these 4f metals are at high risk of supply chain disruption, the development of new recovery technologies is necessary to avoid future shortages, which may impact renewable energy production. This paper reports the synthesis of a non-natural biogenic material as a potential platform for bioinspired lanthanide extraction. The biogenic material takes advantage of the atomically precise structure of a 2D crystalline protein lattice with the high lanthanide binding affinity of hydroxypyridinonate chelators. Luminescence titration data demonstrated that the engineered protein layers have affinities for all tested lanthanides in the micromolar-range (dissociation constants) and a higher binding affinity for the lanthanide ions with a smaller ionic radius. Furthermore, competitive titrations confirmed the higher selectivity (up to several orders of magnitude) of the biogenic material for lanthanides compared to other cations commonly found in f-element sources. Lastly, the functionalized protein layers could be reused in several cycles by desorbing the bound metal with citrate solutions. Taken together, these results highlight biogenic materials as promising bioadsorption platforms for the selective binding of lanthanides, with potential applications in the recovery of these critical elements from waste.\n",

      "The use of nuclear power has been a significant part of the United Kingdom's energy portfolio with the Sellafield site being used for power production and more recently reprocessing and decommissioning of spent nuclear fuel activities. Before being reprocessed, spent nuclear fuel is stored in water ponds with significant levels of background radioactivity and in high alkalinity (to minimize fuel corrosion). Despite these challenging conditions, the presence of microbial communities has been detected. To gain further insight into the microbial communities present in extreme environments, an indoor, hyper-alkaline, oligotrophic, and radioactive spent fuel storage pond (INP) located on the Sellafield site was analyzed. Water samples were collected from sample points within the INP complex, and also the purge water feeding tank (FT) that supplies water to the pond, and were screened for the presence of the 16S and 18S rRNA genes to inform sequencing requirements over a period of 30 months. Only 16S rRNA genes were successfully amplified for sequencing, suggesting that the microbial communities in the INP were dominated by prokaryotes. Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR) analysis targeting 16S rRNA genes suggested that bacterial cells in the order of 104-106 mL-1 were present in the samples, with loadings rising with time. Next generation Illumina MiSeq sequencing was performed to identify the dominant microorganisms at eight sampling times. The 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis suggested that 70% and 91% from of the OTUs samples, from the FT and INP respectively, belonged to the phylum Proteobacteria, mainly from the alpha and beta subclasses. The remaining OTUs were assigned primarily to the phyla Acidobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and, Cyanobacteria. Overall the most abundant genera identified were Hydrogenophaga, Curvibacter, Porphyrobacter, Rhodoferax, Polaromonas, Sediminibacterium, Roseococcus, and Sphingomonas. The presence of organisms most closely related to Hydrogenophaga species in the INP areas, suggests the metabolism of hydrogen as an energy source, most likely linked to hydrolysis of water caused by the stored fuel. Isolation of axenic cultures using a range of minimal and rich media was also attempted, but only relatively minor components (from the phylum Bacteroidetes) of the pond water communities were obtained, emphasizing the importance of DNA-based, not culture-dependent techniques, for assessing the microbiome of nuclear facilities.\n",

      " \n",
      "The X-ray structure of the periplasmic ribose receptor (binding protein) of Escherichia coli (RBP) was solved at 3 A resolution by the method of multiple isomorphous replacement. Alternating cycles of refitting and refinement have resulted in a model structure with an R-factor of 18.7% for 27,526 reflections from 7.5 to 1.7 A resolution (96% of the data). The model contains 2228 non-hydrogen atoms, including all 271 residues of the amino acid sequence, 220 solvent atoms and beta-D-ribose. The protein consists of two highly similar structural domains, each of which is composed of a core of parallel beta-sheet flanked on both sides by alpha-helices. The two domains are related to each other by an almost perfect 2-fold axis of rotation, with the C termini of the beta-strands of each sheet pointing toward the center of the molecule. Three short stretches of amino acid chain (from symmetrically related portions of the protein) link these two domains, and presumably act as a hinge to allow relative movement of the domains in functionally important conformational changes. Two water molecules are also an intrinsic part of the hinge, allowing crucial flexibility in the structure. The ligand beta-D-ribose (in the pyranose form) is bound between the domains, held by interactions with side-chains of the interior loops. The binding site is precisely tailored, with a combination of hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic and steric effects giving rise to tight binding (0.1 microM for ribose) and high specificity. Four out of seven binding-site residues are charged (2 each of aspartate and arginine) and contribute two hydrogen bonds each. The remaining hydrogen bonds are contributed by asparagine and glutamine residues. Three phenylalanine residues supply the hydrophobic component, packing against both faces of the sugar molecule. The arrangement of these hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic residues results in an enclosed binding site with the exact shape of the allowed sugar molecules; in the process of binding, the ligand loses all of its surface-accessible area. The sites of two mutations that affect the rate of folding of the ribose receptor are shown to be located near small cavities in the wild-type protein. The cavities thus allow the incorporation of the larger residues in the mutant proteins. Since these alterations would seriously affect the ability of the protein to build the first portion of the hydrophobic core in the first domain, it is proposed that this process is the rate-limiting step in folding of the ribose receptor.\n",

      "Selective Homogeneous and Heterogeneous Catalytic Conversion of Methanol/Dimethyl Ether to Triptane\n",
      "10.1021/ar2002528\n",
      " \n",
      "The demand for specific fuels and chemical feed-stocks fluctuates, and as a result, logistical mismatches can occur in the supply of their precursor raw materials such as coal, biomass, crude oil, and methane. To overcome these challenges, industry requires a versatile and robust suite of conversion technologies, many of which are mediated by synthesis gas (CO + H(2)) or methanol/dimethyl ether (DME) intermediates. One such transformation, the conversion of methanol/DME to triptane (2,2,3-trimethylbutane) has spurred particular research interest. Practically, triptane is a high-octane, high-value fuel component, but this transformation also raises fundamental questions: how can such a complex molecule be generated from such a simple precursor with high selectivity?  In this Account, we present studies of this reaction carried out in two modes: homogeneously with soluble metal halide catalysts and heterogeneously over solid microporous acid catalysts. Despite their very different compositions, reaction conditions, provenance, and historical scientific context, both processes lead to remarkably similar products and mechanistic interpretations. In both cases, hydrocarbon chains grow by successive methylation in a carbocation-based mechanism. The relative rates of competitive processes-chain growth by methylation, chain termination by hydrogen transfer, isomerization, and cracking-systematically depend upon the structure of the various hydrocarbons produced, strongly favoring the formation of the maximally branched C(7) alkane, triptane.  The two catalysts also show parallels in their dependence on acid strength. Stronger acids exhibit higher methanol/DME conversion but also tend to favor chain termination, isomerization, and cracking relative to chain growth, decreasing the preference for triptane. Hence, in both modes, there will be an optimal range: if the acid strength is too low, activity will be poor, but if it is too high, selectivity will be poor.  A related reaction, the methylative homologation of alkanes, offers the possibility of upgrading low-value refinery byproducts such as isobutane and isopentane to more valuable gasoline components. With the addition of adamantane, a hydride transfer catalyst that promotes activation of alkanes, both systems effectively catalyze the reaction of methanol/DME with lighter alkanes to produce heavier ones. This transformation has the further advantage of providing stoichiometric balance, whereas the stoichiometry for conversion of methanol/DME to alkanes is deficient in hydrogen and requires rejection of excess carbon in the form of carbon-rich arenes, which lowers the overall yield of desired products. Alternatively, other molecules can serve as sacrificial sources of hydrogen atoms: H(2) on heterogeneous catalysts modified by cations that activate it, and H(3)PO(2) or H(3)PO(3) on homogeneous catalysts.  We have interpreted most of the features of these potentially useful reactions at a highly detailed level of mechanistic understanding, and we show that this interpretation applies equally to these two widely disparate types of catalysts. Such approaches can play a key role in developing and optimizing the catalysts that are needed to solve our energy problems.\n",

      "Two methods based on the avidin-biotin technology were developed for the multimonolayer immobilization of Desulfovibrio gigas hydrogenase on glassy carbon or gold electrodes. In both methods the molecular structure of the modified interface was the result of a step-by-step process. The first method alternates monolayers of avidin and biotinylated hydrogenase, the mediator (methyl viologen) being free to diffuse in the structure. In the second method, the avidin monolayers were used to immobilize both the biotinylated enzyme and a long-chain biotinylated viologen derivative. The viologen head of this hydrophilic arm shuttles the electrons between the electrode and the enzyme. The modified electrodes were evaluated for the electroenzymatic oxidation of molecular hydrogen, which has interest for the development of enzymatic fuel cells. The parameters that affect the current density of mediated oxidation of H(2) at the modified electrodes was studied. The second structure, which has given typical catalytic currents of 25 microA per cm(2) for 10 monolayers, was found clearly less efficient than the first structure (500 microA per cm(2) for 10 monolayers). In both methods the catalytic currents increased linearly with the number of monolayers of hydrogenase immobilized, which indicates that the multilayer structures are spatially ordered.\n",

This property is observed clearly in experiments in which an enzyme is adsorbed on an electrode surface which can supply or receive electrons rapidly and in a highly controlled manner. In such a way, the rate of catalysis can be measured accurately as a function of the potential (driving force) that is applied. In this paper, we draw attention to a few examples in which this property has been observed in enzymes that are associated with membrane-bound respiratory chains, and we discuss its possible origins and implications for in vivo regulation.\n",

      "The observation that in isolated mitochondria electrons may leak out of the respiratory chain to form superoxide radicals (O(2)(radical-)) has prompted the assumption that O(2)(radical-) formation is a compulsory by-product of respiration. Since mitochondrial O(2)(radical-) formation under homeostatic conditions could not be demonstrated in situ so far, conclusions drawn from isolated mitochondria must be considered with precaution. The present study reveals a link between electron deviation from the respiratory chain to oxygen and the coupling state in the presence of antimycin A. Another important factor is the analytical system applied for the detection of activated oxygen species. Due to the presence of superoxide dismutase in mitochondria, O(2)(radical-) release cannot be realistically determined in intact mitochondria. We therefore followed the release of the stable dismutation product H(2)O(2) by comparing most frequently used H(2)O(2) detection methods. The possible interaction of the detection systems with the respiratory chain was avoided by a recently developed method, which was compared with conventional methods. Irrespective of the methods applied, the substrates used for respiration and the state of respiration established, intact mitochondria could not be made to release H(2)O(2) from dismutating O(2)(radical-). Although regular mitochondrial respiration is unlikely to supply single electrons for O(2)(radical-) formation our study does not exclude the possibility of the respiratory chain becoming a radical source under certain conditions.\n",

      " \n",
      "Ion pairing interactions between oppositely charged amino acids are important for protein structure stability. Despite the apparent electrostatic nature of these interactions, the charged amino acids Lys, Arg, Glu, and Asp have a different number of hydrophobic methylenes linking the charged functionality to the backbone. To investigate the effect of Glu (and Asp) side chain length on ion pairing interactions, a series of 36 monomeric α-helical peptides containing Zbb-Xaa (i, i+3), (i, i+4), and (i, i+5) (Zbb = Aad, Glu, Asp; Xaa = Lys, Orn, Dab, Dap) sequence patterns were studied by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy at pH 7 and 2. Peptides with Glu and Aad exhibited similar helicity and pH dependence, whereas peptides with Asp behaved distinctly different. The side chain interaction energetics were derived from the CD data using the nesting block method coupled with modified Lifson-Roig theory. At pH 7, no Zbb-Xaa (i, i+5) interaction was observed, regardless of side chain length (consistent with the helix geometry). Interestingly, only Lys was capable of supporting Zbb-Xaa (i, i+3) interactions, whereas any Xaa side chain length supported Zbb-Xaa (i, i+4) interactions. In particular, the magnitude of both Zbb(-)-Lys (i, i+4) and Zbb(-)-Orn (i, i+4) interaction energies followed the trend Asp > Glu > Aad. Side chain conformational analysis by molecular mechanics calculations showed that the Zbb-Xaa (i, i+3) interactions involved the χ(1) dihedral combination (g+, g+) for the i and i+3 residues, whereas the Zbb-Xaa (i, i+4) interactions were supported by the χ(1) dihedral combination (t, g+) for the i and i+4 residues. These calculated low energy conformers were consistent with conformations of intrahelical Asp-Lys and Glu-Lys salt bridges in a nonredundant protein structure database. These results suggest that Asp and Glu provide natural variation, and lengthening the Glu side chain further to Aad does not furnish additional characteristics that Glu cannot supply.\n",

      "The treatment and disposal of waste activated sludge (WAS) has become one of the major challenges for the wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) due to large output, high treatment costs and enriched substantial emerging contaminants (ECs). Therefore, reducing sludge volume, recovering energy and resource from WAS, and removing ECs and decreasing environmental risk have gained increasing attentions. Calcium peroxide (CaO2), a versatile and safe peroxide, has been widely applied in terms of WAS treatment including sludge dewatering, anaerobic sludge digestion and anaerobic sludge fermentation due to its specific properties such as generating free radicals and alkali, etc., providing supports for sludge reduction, recycling, and risk mitigation. This review outlines comprehensively the recent progresses and breakthroughs of CaO2 in the fields of sludge treatment. In particular, the relevant mechanisms of CaO2 enhancing WAS dewaterability, methane production from anaerobic digestion, short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) and hydrogen production from anaerobic fermentation, and the removal of ECs in WAS and role of experiment parameters are systematically elucidated and discussed, respectively. Finally, the knowledge gaps and opportunities in CaO2-based sludge treatment technologies that need to be focused in the future are prospected. The review presented can supply a theoretical basis and technical reference for the application of CaO2 for improving the treatment of WAS.\n",

In the coming years, an increased supply of shorter-chain alkanes from natural and shale gas will offer new opportunities for inexpensive carbon feedstock through such dehydrogenation processes. Existing methods for alkane dehydrogenation using heterogeneous catalysts require harsh reaction conditions and have a lack of selectivity, whereas homogeneous catalysis methods result in significant waste generation. A strong need exists for atom-efficient alkane dehydrogenations on a useful scale. Herein, we have developed improved acceptorless catalytic systems under optimal light transmittance conditions using trans-[Rh(PMe3)2(CO)Cl] as the catalyst with different additives. Unprecedented catalyst turnover numbers are obtained for the dehydrogenation of cyclic and linear (from C4) alkanes and liquid organic hydrogen carriers.

      "FoF1-ATP synthase is the nanomotor responsible for most of ATP synthesis in the cell. In physiological conditions, it carries out ATP synthesis thanks to a proton gradient generated by the respiratory chain in the inner mitochondrial membrane. We previously reported that isolated myelin vesicles (IMV) contain functional FoF1-ATP synthase and respiratory chain complexes and are able to conduct an aerobic metabolism, to support the axonal energy demand. In this study, by biochemical assay, Western Blot (WB) analysis and immunofluorescence microscopy, we characterized the IMV FoF1-ATP synthase. ATP synthase activity decreased in the presence of the specific inhibitors (olygomicin, DCCD, FCCP, valynomicin/nigericin) and respiratory chain inhibitors (antimycin A, KCN), suggesting a coupling of oxygen consumption and ATP synthesis. ATPase activity was inhibited in low pH conditions. WB and microscopy analyses of both IMV and optic nerves showed that the Inhibitor of F1 (IF1), a small protein that binds the F1 moiety in low pH when of oxygen supply is impaired, is expressed in myelin sheath. Data are discussed in terms of the role of IF1 in the prevention of the reversal of ATP synthase in myelin sheath during central nervous system ischemic events. Overall, data are consistent with an energetic role of myelin sheath, and may shed light on the relationship among demyelination and axonal degeneration.\n",

      "The PsbO protein is an essential extrinsic subunit of photosystem II, the pigment-protein complex responsible for light-driven water splitting. Water oxidation in photosystem II supplies electrons to the photosynthetic electron transfer chain and is accompanied by proton release and oxygen evolution. While the electron transfer steps in this process are well defined and characterized, the driving forces acting on the liberated protons, their dynamics and their destiny are all largely unknown. It was suggested that PsbO undergoes proton-induced conformational changes and forms hydrogen bond networks that ensure prompt proton removal from the catalytic site of water oxidation, i.e. the Mn4 CaO5 cluster. This work reports the purification and characterization of heterologously expressed PsbO from green algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and two isoforms from the higher plant Solanum tuberosum (PsbO1 and PsbO2). A comparison to the spinach PsbO reveals striking similarities in intrinsic protein fluorescence and CD spectra, reflecting the near-identical secondary structure of the proteins from algae and higher plants. Titration experiments using the hydrophobic fluorescence probe ANS revealed that eukaryotic PsbO proteins exhibit acid-base hysteresis. This hysteresis is a dynamic effect accompanied by changes in the accessibility of the protein's hydrophobic core and is not due to reversible oligomerization or unfolding of the PsbO protein. These results confirm the hypothesis that pH-dependent dynamic behavior at physiological pH ranges is a common feature of PsbO proteins and causes reversible opening and closing of their β-barrel domain in response to the fluctuating acidity of the thylakoid lumen.\n",

The effects of harvest maturity and storage duration on fruit quality attributes during a 6-wk period of cold storage (5°C, 95% RH) and subsequent 5 d of shelf life (20°C, 75% RH) were investigated. Instrumental evaluation of aril color, juice content, juice absorbance (520 nm), total soluble solids (TSS), pH, titratable acids (TA), and phytochemical components including total phenolics, flavonoids, and anthocyanins were carried out. Textural properties of arils which included hardness, toughness, bioyield point, and Young's modulus were also investigated. During the shelf life period, arils from individual fruit were rated by a trained sensory panel based on appearance, taste, and texture. Relationships between the instrumental and descriptive sensory data were explored and fruit harvest maturities were discriminated using discriminant analysis. Among the attributes evaluated, TSS : TA, sweet taste, and the CIE hue angle (h°) were the most decisive attributes distinguishing the harvest maturities. The optimum time for harvesting was at 143 DAFB (H2) when fruit TSS : TA ratio was > 55, which coincided with significantly higher rating for sweet taste in fruit at H2 than at H1 and H3 during shelf life. The harvest index proposed in the current study could be used as a guide to establish a reliable harvest maturity index to assist in assuring fruit quality in consideration of long supply chains for the investigated cultivar.\n",

During degradation the physical parameters of the crude oils (e.g. density, viscosity, average molecular weight) were altered and shifted into the direction of heavy oil. In vitro degraded oil is very similar to oil degraded in nature. Aromatic hydrocarbons and biomarker molecules (steranes and triterpanes) were not degraded under the conditions used. Pyrolysis-GC analysis of asphaltenes revealed no significant changes in the composition of pyrolyzates during biodegradation. There is sufficient evidence that heavy oils - besides some other effects - are generated by the in situ-biodegradation of conventional oils.\n",

      "The metabolism of urea by urease enzymes of oral bacteria has a profound influence on oral biofilm pH homeostasis and oral microbial ecology, and Actinomyces naeslundii is an important ureolytic organism in the oral cavity. To gain an insight into the regulation of urease gene expression in cells of A. naeslundii growing in biofilms under different environmental conditions, the behavior of A. naeslundii ATCC12104 was examined in in vitro biofilms. The strain was grown in a chemostat biofilm reactor, and at a quasi-steady state, the urease activity of biofilm cells was measured and transcription of ureC gene was detected with Taqman quantitative PCR. The effect of environmental changes on urease expression was examined by varying the environmental pH, dilution rate, carbohydrate and nitrogen availability of the fluid phase of the culture. The results showed that the conditions of neutral pH, fast dilution rate, increased carbohydrate supply or low nitrogen supply in the medium all resulted in enhancement of urease activity in biofilm cells. But only low nitrogen availability and a fast dilution rate were observed to lead to an increase in ureC mRNA levels. This suggests that nitrogen availability and dilution rate can influence the urease activity of A. naeslundii by modulating ureC gene transcription.\n",

      "10.1021/acsami.1c05145\n",
      " \n",
      "Large amounts of food are wasted during the food supply chain. This loss is in part due to consumer confusion over dates on food packages that can indicate a variety of quality indicators in the product (e.g., expiration date, \"best by\" date, \"sell by\" dates, etc.). To reduce this food loss, much research has been focused on the films that offer simple and easily manipulated indication systems to detect food spoilage. However, these materials are usually hydrophilic biopolymers that can detect the food spoilage in a wide pH range but do not provide highly sensitive real-time measurements. In this work, a glycerol-based nanocomposite core-shell latex film was synthesized to create a responsive packaging material that can provide real-time pH detection of food with high sensitivity. First, the pH-responsive dendrimer comonomer was synthesized from glycerol and diamine. Then, the nanoencapsulation polymerization process via miniemulsion was conducted to form a core-shell structure with tunable nanoshell thickness for a sensible pH-responsive release (<0.5 pH change). Next, the flexible film encapsulated a color-indicative dye that provided highly sensitive and visible color changes as both the pH dropped and the time elapsed in the food. This film also provided a barrier to water and heat and resisted deformation. Ultimately, this nanocomposite flexible film pending a pH sensor has the potential as an intelligent food packaging material for a universal, accurate, easy-to-use, and real-time food spoilage monitoring system to reduce food waste.\n",

      "The economic developments around the globe resulted in the increased demand of energy, which overburdened the supply chain sources of energy. Fossil fuel reserves are exploited to meet the high demand of energy and their combustion is becoming the main source of environmental pollution. So there is dire need to find safe, renewable and sustainable energy resources. Waste to energy (WtE) may be viewed as a possible alternate source of energy, which is economically and environmentally sustainable. Municipal solid waste (MSW) is a major contributor to the development of renewable energy and sustainable environment. At present the scarcity of renewable energy resources and disposal of MSW is a challenging problem for the developing countries, which has generated a wide ranging socioeconomic and environmental problems. This situation stimulates the researchers to develop alternatives for converting WtE under a variety of scenarios. Herein, the present scenario in developing the WtE technologies such as, thermal conversion methods (Incineration, Gasification, Pyrolysis, Torrefaction), Plasma technology, Biochemical methods, Chemical and Mechanical methods, Bio-electrochemical process, Mechanical biological treatment (MBT), Photo-biological processes for efficacious energy recovery and the challenges confronted by developing and developed countries. In this review, a framework for the evaluation of WtE technologies has been presented for the ease of researchers working in the field. Furthermore, this review concluded that WtE is a potential renewable energy source that will partially satisfy the demand for energy and ensure an efficient MSW management to overcome the environmental pollution.\n",

      "K(+) uptake in the high-affinity range of concentrations and its components have been widely studied. In Arabidposis thaliana, the AtHAK5 transporter and the AtAKT1 channel have been shown to be the main transport proteins involved in this process. Here, we study the role of these two systems under two important stress conditions: low K(+) supply or the presence of salinity. T-DNA insertion lines disrupting AtHAK5 and AtAKT1 are employed for long-term experiments that allow physiological characterization of the mutant lines. We found that AtHAK5 is required for K(+) absorption necessary to sustain plant growth at low K(+) in the absence as well as in the presence of salinity. Salinity greatly reduced AtHAK5 transcript levels and promoted AtAKT1-mediated K(+) efflux, resulting in an important impairment of K(+) nutrition. Although having a limited capacity, AtHAK5 plays a major role for K(+) acquisition from low K(+) concentrations in the presence of salinity.\n",

      "Most eukaryotic cells depend on mitochondrial OXidative PHOSphorylation (OXPHOS) in their ATP supply. The cellular consequences of OXPHOS defects and the pathophysiological mechanisms in related disorders are incompletely understood. Using a quantitative proteomics approach we provide evidence that a genetic defect of complex-I of the OXPHOS system may associate with transcriptional derangements of mitochondrial biogenesis through stabilization of the master transcriptional regulator PPARγ co-activator 1α (PGC-1α) protein. Chronic oxidative stress suppresses the gene expression of PGC-1α but concomitant inhibition of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) can stabilize this co-activator protein, thereby inducing its downstream metabolic gene expression programs. Thus, mitochondrial biogenesis, which lays at the heart of the homeostatic control of energy metabolism, can be deregulated by secondary impairments of the protein turnover machinery.\n",

      "Approximately half of all vaccines produced annually are wasted because effectivity is dependent on protein structure and heat exposure disrupts the intermolecular interactions needed to maintain the structure. Thus, most vaccines require a temperature-controlled supply chain to minimize waste. A more sustainable technology was developed via the adsorption of invasion plasmid antigen D (IpaD) onto mesoporous silica, improving the thermal stability of this protein-based therapeutic. Seven silicas were characterized to determine the effects of pore diameter, pore volume, and surface area on protein adsorption. The silica-IpaD complex was then heated above the IpaD denaturing temperature and N,N-dimethyldodecylamine N-oxide was used to remove IpaD from the silica. Circular dichroism confirmed that the adsorbed IpaD after the heat treatment maintained a native secondary structure rich in α-helix content. In contrast, the unprotected IpaD after heat treatment lost its secondary structure. Isotherms using Langmuir, Freundlich, and Temkin models demonstrated that the adsorption of IpaD onto silicas is best fit by the Langmuir model. If pores are less than 15 nm, adsorption is negligible. If the pores are between 15 and 25 nm, then monolayer coverage is achieved and IpaD is protected from thermal denaturing. If pores are larger than 25 nm, the adsorption is a multilayer coverage and it is easier to remove the protein from the silica because of a less-developed hydrogen bond network. This case study provides strong evidence that IpaD is thermally stabilized via adsorption on mesoporous silica with the proper range of pore sizes.\n",

      " \n",
      "The degradation of the antibiotic thiamphenicol has been studied by photoelectro-Fenton (PEF) process with UVA light using pyrite particles as catalyst source. Pyrite is a sulfide mineral that naturally acidifies the reaction medium and releases Fe2+, thus promoting the effective generation of OH from Fenton's reaction. The assays were made in an IrO2/air-diffusion cell, which yielded similar results to a boron-doped diamond (BDD)/air-diffusion one at a lower cost. In dark conditions, electro-Fenton (EF) process showed an analogous ability for drug removal, but mineralization was much poorer because of the large persistence of highly stable by-products. Their photolysis explained the higher performance of PEF. Conventional homogeneous PEF directly using dissolved Fe2+ exhibited a lower mineralization power. This suggests the occurrence of heterogeneous Fenton's reaction over the pyrite surface. The effect of current density and drug content on pyrite-catalyzed PEF performance was examined. The drug heteroatoms were gradually converted into SO42-, Cl- and NO3- ions. Nine aromatic derivatives and two dichloroaliphatic amines were identified by GC-MS, and five short-chain carboxylic acids were detected by ion-exclusion HPLC. A reaction route for thiamphenicol mineralization by PEF process with continuous H2O2 and Fe2+ supply on site is proposed.\n",

      "Hibernating mammals rely heavily on lipid metabolism to supply energy during hibernation. We wondered if the fatty acid binding protein from a hibernator responded to temperature differently than that from a nonhibernator. We found that the Kd for oleate of the liver fatty acid binding protein (1.5 microM) isolated from ground squirrel (Spermophilus richardsonii) was temperature insensitive over 5-37 degrees C, while the rat liver fatty acid binding protein was affected with the Kd at 37 degrees C being about half (0.8 microM) that found at lower temperatures. This same trend was observed when comparing the specificity of various fatty acids of differing chain length and degree of unsaturation for the two proteins at 5 and 37 degrees C. At the lower temperature, ground squirrel protein bound long-chain unsaturated fatty acids, particularly linoleate and linolenate, at least as well as at the higher temperature and matched requirements for these fatty acids in the diet. The most common long-chain fatty acid, palmitate, was a more effective ligand for ground squirrel liver fatty acid binding protein at 5 degrees C than at 37 degrees C, with the opposite occurring in the eutherm. Rat protein was clearly not adapted to function optimally at temperatures lower than the animal's body temperature.\n",

      "In mouse pancreatic islets the kinetics of insulin secretion and O2 uptake in response to the non-metabolizable leucine analogue (+/-)-BCH (2-endo- aminonorbornane -2-carboxylic acid) were compared. In addition, the fuel-mobilizing effect of (+/-)-BCH was studied with a mitochondrial fraction from islets. (1) Within 2 min 20 mM-(+/-)-BCH markedly enhanced insulin release or O2 consumption by islets respiring in the absence of exogenous fuels. During prolonged exposure to 20 mM-(+/-)-BCH secretion declined more rapidly than O2 uptake. (2) L-Glutamine (10 mM) prevented the decrease of both insulin release and O2 uptake of islets exposed to 20mM-(+/-)-BCH. During the second phase of insulin release in response to 20 mM-(+/-)-BCH + 10 mM-L-glutamine, kinetics of secretion and respiration correlated closely. (3) Initial peaks were consistently seen in the (+/-)-BCH-induced secretory profiles, but never in the respiratory profiles. (4) In contrast with L-glycerol 3-phosphate, L-malate or pyruvate, L-glutamine or L-glutamate maintained low rates of oxidative phosphorylation in B-cell mitochondria. The effects of L-glutamine or L-glutamate were potentiated severalfold by (+/-)-BCH. (5) The effects of other branched-chain amino acids on oxidative phosphorylation resembled their effects on insulin release, redox state of nicotinamide nucleotides and glutamate dehydrogenase activity.

      "The conversion of carbonyl compounds into alcohols or their derivatives via the catalytic transfer hydrogenation (CTH) process known as Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley reduction is an important reaction in the reaction chain involved in biomass transformation. The rational design of efficient catalysts using natural and renewable materials is critical for decreasing the catalyst cost and for the sustainable supply of raw materials during catalyst preparation. In this study, a novel hafnium-based catalyst was constructed using naturally existing tannic acid as the ligand. The prepared hafnium-tannic acid (Hf-TA) catalyst was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and thermogravimetry (TG). Hf-TA was applied in the conversion of furfuraldehyde (FD) to furfuryl alcohol (FA) using isopropanol (2-PrOH) as both the reaction solvent and the hydrogen source. Both preparation conditions and the effects of the reaction parameters on the performance of the catalyst were studied. Under the relatively mild reaction conditions of 70 °C and 3 h, FD (1 mmol) could be converted into FA with a high yield of 99.0%. In addition, the Hf-TA catalyst could be reused at least ten times without a notable decrease in activity and selectivity, indicating its excellent stability. It was proved that Hf-TA could also catalyze the conversion of various carbonyl compounds with different structures. The high efficiency, natural occurrence of tannic acid, and facile preparation process make Hf-TA a potential catalyst for applications in the biomass conversion field.\n",

The inner PB not only acts like a catalase for hydrogen peroxide decomposition but also serves as a photothermal agent to increase the local temperature and then speed up the oxygen supply under near-infrared irradiation. The loaded ZnPc can immediately transform the formed oxygen to generate cytotoxic singlet oxygen upon the same laser irradiation due to the overlapped absorption between PB and ZnPc.

      " \n",
      "In aerobic organisms, oxygen is essential for efficient energy production, and it acts as the last acceptor of the mitochondrial electron transport chain and as regulator of gene expression. However, excessive oxygen can lead to production of deleterious reactive oxygen species. Therefore, the directed migration of single cells or cell clumps from hypoxic areas toward a region of optimal oxygen concentration, named aerotaxis, can be considered an adaptive mechanism that plays a major role in biological and pathological processes. One relevant example is the development of O2 gradients when tumors grow beyond their vascular supply, leading frequently to metastasis. In higher eukaryotic organisms, aerotaxis has only recently begun to be explored, but genetically amenable model organisms suitable to dissect this process remain an unmet need. In this regard, we sought to assess whether Dictyostelium cells, which are an established model for chemotaxis and other motility processes, could sense oxygen gradients and move directionally in their response. By assessing different physical parameters, our findings indicate that both growing and starving Dictyostelium cells under hypoxic conditions migrate directionally toward regions of higher O2 concentration. This migration is characterized by a specific pattern of cell arrangement. A thickened circular front of high cell density (corona) forms in the cell cluster and persistently moves following the oxygen gradient. Cells in the colony center, where hypoxia is more severe, are less motile and display a rounded shape. Aggregation-competent cells forming streams by chemotaxis, when confined under hypoxic conditions, undergo stream or aggregate fragmentation, giving rise to multiple small loose aggregates that coordinately move toward regions of higher O2 concentration. By testing a panel of mutants defective in chemotactic signaling, and a catalase-deficient strain, we found that the latter and the pkbR1 null exhibited altered migration patterns. Our results suggest that in Dictyostelium, like in mammalian cells, an intracellular accumulation of hydrogen peroxide favors the migration toward optimal oxygen concentration. Furthermore, differently from chemotaxis, this oxygen-driven migration is a G protein-independent process.\n",

      "Human DHRS6 is a previously uncharacterized member of the short chain dehydrogenases/reductase family and displays significant homologies to bacterial hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenases. Substrate screening reveals sole NAD(+)-dependent conversion of (R)-hydroxybutyrate to acetoacetate with K(m) values of about 10 mm, consistent with plasma levels of circulating ketone bodies in situations of starvation or ketoacidosis. The structure of human DHRS6 was determined at a resolution of 1.8 A in complex with NAD(H) and reveals a tetrameric organization with a short chain dehydrogenases/reductase-typical folding pattern. A highly conserved triad of Arg residues (\"triple R\" motif consisting of Arg(144), Arg(188), and Arg(205)) was found to bind a sulfate molecule at the active site. Docking analysis of R-beta-hydroxybutyrate into the active site reveals an experimentally consistent model of substrate carboxylate binding and catalytically competent orientation. GFP reporter gene analysis reveals a cytosolic localization upon transfection into mammalian cells. These data establish DHRS6 as a novel, cytosolic type 2 (R)-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase, distinct from its well characterized mitochondrial type 1 counterpart. The properties determined for DHRS6 suggest a possible physiological role in cytosolic ketone body utilization, either as a secondary system for energy supply in starvation or to generate precursors for lipid and sterol synthesis.\n",

      "With the increasing demand for carbon neutrality, the development of renewable and recycle green energy has attracted wide attention from researchers. A novel self-healing triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) was constructed by applying a linear silicone-modified polyurethane (PU) coating as a triboelectric layer, which was obtained by reacting hydroxypropyl silicone oil and hexamethylene diisocyanate under the catalysis of Sn. The linear self-healing coating as the friction electrode could effectively alleviate the damages of TENG devices during long-term energy harvesting. When the triboelectric layer of the TENG device shows abrasion, the broken silicone-modified polyurethane polymer chains would gradually be cross-linked again through hydrogen bonding to achieve a self-healing effect. The entire self-healing process of the friction coating could be completed in 30 min at room temperature. The PU-based self-healing TENG exhibits an evident and stable output performance with a short-circuit current of 31.9 μA and output voltage of 517.5 V after multiple cutting-healing cycles, which could light 480 commercial LEDs. Besides, a self-powered cathodic protection system supplied by the self-healing TENG was constructed, which could transfer negative triboelectric charges to the protected metal surface to achieve an anti-corrosion effect by harvesting mechanical energy. Due to the self-healing characteristics of the TENG device as the power supply part, this intelligent system possesses great application potential in the long-term corrosion protection of multiple metal application industries, such as the marine industry.\n",

      "Oxidative stress in skeletal muscle is a hallmark of various pathophysiologic states that also feature increased reliance on long-chain fatty acid (LCFA) substrate, such as insulin resistance and exercise. However, little is known about the mechanistic basis of the LCFA-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) burden in intact mitochondria, and elucidation of this mechanistic basis was the goal of this study. Specific aims were to determine the extent to which LCFA catabolism is associated with ROS production and to gain mechanistic insights into the associated ROS production. Because intermediates and by-products of LCFA catabolism may interfere with antioxidant mechanisms, we predicted that ROS formation during LCFA catabolism reflects a complex process involving multiple sites of ROS production as well as modified mitochondrial function. Thus, we utilized several complementary approaches to probe the underlying mechanism(s). Using skeletal muscle mitochondria, our findings indicate that even a low supply of LCFA is associated with ROS formation in excess of that generated by NADH-linked substrates. Moreover, ROS production was evident across the physiologic range of membrane potential and was relatively insensitive to membrane potential changes. Determinations of topology and membrane potential as well as use of inhibitors revealed complex III and the electron transfer flavoprotein (ETF) and ETF-oxidoreductase, as likely sites of ROS production. Finally, ROS production was sensitive to matrix levels of LCFA catabolic intermediates, indicating that mitochondrial export of LCFA catabolic intermediates can play a role in determining ROS levels.\n",

      "We have developed a method for the rapid infusion into plasma of large amounts of long-chain free fatty acids (FFA). Unanesthetized dogs were connected by a peripheral artery to a closed, continuousflow centrifuge from which cells and plasma emerged in separate lines. Sodium oleate was infused directly into the plasma line before cells and plasma were recombined and returned to the animal through a peripheral vein.The centrifugation procedure itself produced only small changes in circulating levels of glucose, FFA, and electrolytes. Plasma flow rates as high as 100 ml/min could be maintained, and centrifugations of 12 hr were accomplished without complications. During centrifugation, sodium oleate was infused at rates up to 80 muEq/kg per min for 2.5 hr; the maximum molar ratio of FFA to albumin without hemolysis was 10:1. Plasma FFA levels rose rapidly after infusions were started and reached constant elevated levels within 15-20 min. Oleate infusion at 10-50 muEq/kg per min produced a rise in plasma FFA proportional to the infusion rate. The maximum increment in plasma FFA above control values was 1.66 muEq/ml. When infusions ended, plasma FFA declined rapidly to control levels. Oleate infusion at rates below 30 muEq/kg per min did not reduce levels of other plasma FFA. Infusion at high rates was accompanied by a marked fall in blood glucose. This method permits adminsitration of long-chain fatty acids in sufficient quantities to study their individual metabolic effects, and provides a new way to supply lipid calories parenterally.\n",

      "The blue-green alga Anabaena cylindrica is found to consume molecular hydrogen in a hydrogenase dependent reaction. This hydrogen uptake proceeds in the dark and is strictly dependent on oxygen, thus representing a Knallgas reactions. Its rate is almost as high as that of the endogenous respiration in Anabaena. Studies with inhibitors reveal that hydrogen is utilized via the complete respiratory chain providing additional energy for the alga. CO plus C2H2 completely block the Knallgas reaction which explains the previously reported considerable increase in the total H2 formation representing the difference between the nitrogenase-dependent H2-evolution and the reutilization of the gas catalysed by the hydrogenase in intact Anabaena.H2 is able to support the C2H2-reduction in the dark in a reaction again strictly dependent on oxygen. Moreover, H2 is also consumed in experiments carried out under far red light and in the presence of dichlorophenyl-dimenthyl-urea (DCMU) where the energy for nitrogen fixation is no longer provided by respiration but by cyclic photophosphorylation. Under these conditions, H2 is found to supply electrons for the formation of C2H4 from C2H2 in a reaction no longer dependent on the presence of oxygen. Moreover, in these experiments, the presence of H2 stabilizes the C2H2-reduction activity against the deleterious effect of oxygen.Thus, this communication provides evidence for a triplicate function of the H2-uptake catalysed by hydrogenase in intact Anabaena which is (a) to provide energy by the Knallgas reaction, (b) to supply reducing equivalents for nitrogenase, (c) to protect nitrogenase from damage by oxygen.\n",

      "BACKGROUND & AIMS: HCO(3)(-) supply to the enterocyte is rate limiting for duodenal HCO(3)(-) secretion (J(HCO3-)). This study defines the molecular nature of the major HCO(3)(-) uptake pathways in rabbit duodenocytes and investigates their physiologic significance and regulation during basal and stimulated J(HCO3-). METHODS & RESULTS: pH gradient-driven (22)Na(+) uptake into duodenal basolateral membrane vesicles was partly HCO(3)(-) dependent, stilbene sensitive, and therefore mediated by Na(+)HCO(3)(-) cotransport, and partly HCO(3)(-) independent, Hoechst 642 sensitive, and therefore mediated by the Na(+)/H(+) exchanger isoform NHE1. Semiquantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) revealed high duodenal expression levels for the NBC1 isoform of the Na(+)HCO(3)(-) cotransporter gene family and NHE1. Cloning and comparison of full-length rabbit with human gastrointestinal and kidney NBC1 subtype revealed a conserved protein kinase A consensus sequence in the cytoplasmic N-terminus of the gastrointestinal NBC1. Inhibition of either Na(+)HCO(3)(-) cotransport or carbonic anhydrase reduced ouabain-sensitive J(HCO3-) in in vitro rabbit duodenal mucosae by approximately 50%, but did not affect 8-Br-cAMP-induced DeltaJ(HCO3-), suggesting cAMP-mediated up-regulation of the alternative pathway. However, inhibition of both Na(+)HCO(3)(-) cotransport and either carbonic anhydrase or NHE1 strongly reduced DeltaJ(HCO3-). CONCLUSIONS: NBC1 and NHE1 are the major base importers in rabbit duodenocytes. Na(+)HCO(3)(-) cotransport and CO(2) hydration/Na(+)/H(+) exchange are equally important pathways for duodenal HCO(3)(-) supply and are up-regulated during cAMP-mediated stimulation.\n",

      "BackgroundNADPH is used as a reductant in various biosynthetic reactions. Cell-free bio-systems have gained considerable attention owing to their high energy utilization and time efficiency. Efforts have been made to continuously supply reducing power to the reaction mixture in a cyclical manner. The thylakoid membrane (TM) is a promising molecular energy generator, producing NADPH under light. Thus, TM sustainability is of major relevance for its in vitro utilization.ResultsOver 70% of TMs prepared from Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 existed in a sealed vesicular structure, with the F1 complex of ATP synthase facing outward (right-side-out), producing NADPH and ATP under light. The NADPH generation activity of TM increased approximately two-fold with the addition of carbonyl cyanide-p-(trifluoromethoxy) phenylhydrazone (FCCP) or removal of the F1 complex using EDTA. Thus, the uncoupling of proton translocation from the electron transport chain or proton leakage through the Fo complex resulted in greater NADPH generation. Biosilicified TM retained more than 80% of its NADPH generation activity after a week at 30°C in the dark. However, activity declined sharply to below 30% after two days in light. The introduction of engineered water-forming NADPH oxidase (Noxm) to keep the electron transport chain of TM working resulted in the improved sustainability of NADPH generation activity in a ratio (Noxm to TM)-dependent manner, which correlated with the decrease of singlet oxygen generation. Removal of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by catalase further highlighted the sustainable NADPH generation activity of up to 80% in two days under light.ConclusionReducing power generated by light energy has to be consumed for TM sustainability. Otherwise, TM can generate singlet oxygen, causing oxidative damage. Thus, TMs should be kept in the dark when not in use. Although NADPH generation activity by TM can be extended via silica encapsulation, further removal of hydrogen peroxide results in an improvement of TM sustainability. Therefore, as long as ROS formation by TM in light is properly handled, it can be used as a promising source of reducing power for in vitro biochemical reactions.Graphical Abstract\n",

      " \n",
      "BACKGROUND: Autologous fat transplantation has become increasingly popular in plastic surgery. However, high resorption rate limits the utility of this technique. To address this problem, this study examined fat transplantation with oxygen-generating microspheres and adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) in a rat model. METHODS: The rats were assigned to four groups. Group 1 had fat transplantation only; group 2, fat transplantation with oxygen-generating microspheres; group 3, fat transplantation with ASCs; group 4, fat transplantation with oxygen-generating microspheres and ASCs. RESULTS: At postoperative 2 weeks, compared to the control group, weight and volume increased significantly in groups 3 and 4. The survival distance of fat cells from the margin of transplanted tissue was 247 μm in group 1, 379 μm group 2, 521 μm in group 3, and 669 μm in group 4. All of the experimental groups were significantly increased. Growth factors (fibroblast growth factor- 2 [FGF-2], insulin-like growth factor-1, epidermal growth factor, and vascular endothelial growth factor) analysis was performed through real-time polymerase chain reaction. Compared to the control group, the mean of the periods was statistically significant at FGF-2 in group 3 and FGF-2, insulin-like growth factor-1, and epidermal growth factor in group 4. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, fat transplantation was improved with oxygen-generating microspheres and ASCs. The oxygen-generating microspheres supply oxygen to adipocytes and ASCs where diffusion does not occur, increasing cell survival rate. Surviving ASCs become involved in the metabolic processes for adipocytes and induce angiogenesis. Therefore, fat transplantation result was improved. Excessive oxygen supply, however, reduces angiogenesis and may cause oxygen toxicity. So, further evaluation of oxygen-generating microspheres is necessary for application to tissues to determine appropriate oxygen concentration and a valid oxygen release period.\n",

      " \n",
      "Even a moderate increase in the cellular cysteine supply elevates the intracellular glutathione (GSH) and glutathione disulfide (GSSG) levels and potentiates immunological functions of lymphocytes in vitro. At low GSSG levels, T cells cannot optimally activate the immunologically important transcription factor NF kappa B, whereas high GSSG levels inhibit the DNA binding activity of NF kappa B. The effects of GSSG are antagonized by reduced thioredoxin (TRX). As the protein tyrosine kinase activities p56lck and p59fyn are activated in intact cells by hydrogen peroxide, they are likely targets for GSSG action. These redox-regulated enzymes trigger signal cascades for NF kappa B activation and transduce signals from the T cell antigen receptor, from CD4 and CD8 molecules, and from the IL-2 receptor beta-chain. The effector phase of cytotoxic T cell responses and IL-2-dependent functions are inhibited even by a partial depletion of the intracellular GSH pool. As signal transduction is facilitated by prooxidant conditions, we propose that the well-known immunological consequences of GSH depletion ultimately may be results of the accompanying GSSG deficiency. As HIV-infected patients and SIV-infected rhesus macaques have, on the average, significantly decreased plasma cyst(e)ine and intracellular GSH levels, we also hypothesize that AIDS may be the consequence of a GSSG deficiency as well.\n",

This study on the effects of Al/Fe molar ratio on the performance of a complex compound formed by polysilicic acid, aluminium and ferric salt (PAFS) showed that PAFS with Al/Fe ratio of 10:3 seemed to have the best coagulation performance in removing turbidity and color. Experimental results showed that under the conditions of polymerization time of 15 d, sedimentation time of 12 min, and pH of 6-8, PAFS with Al/Fe molar ratio of 10:3 had the best coagulation efficiency and lowest residual Al concentration. The turbidity decreased from 23.8 NTU to 3.23 NTU and the residual Al concentration was only 0.165 mg/L in the product water. It could be speculated that colloidal impurities and particulate Al were removed by adsorption bridging and electrical neutralization of long chain inorganic polymer coagulants.\n",

      " \n",
      "Salvia sclarea L. is a Cd2+ tolerant medicinal herb with antifungal and antimicrobial properties cultivated for its pharmacological properties. However, accumulation of high Cd2+ content in its tissues increases the adverse health effects of Cd2+ in humans. Therefore, there is a serious demand to lower human Cd2+ intake. The purpose of our study was to evaluate the mitigative role of excess Zn2+ supply to Cd2+ uptake/translocation and toxicity in clary sage. Salvia plants were treated with excess Cd2+ (100 μM CdSO4) alone, and in combination with Zn2+ (900 μM ZnSO4), in modified Hoagland nutrient solution. The results demonstrate that S. sclarea plants exposed to Cd2+ toxicity accumulated a significant amount of Cd2+ in their tissues, with higher concentrations in roots than in leaves. Cadmium exposure enhanced total Zn2+ uptake but also decreased its translocation to leaves. The accumulated Cd2+ led to a substantial decrease in photosystem II (PSII) photochemistry and disrupted the chloroplast ultrastructure, which coincided with an increased lipid peroxidation. Zinc application decreased Cd2+ uptake and translocation to leaves, while it mitigated oxidative stress, restoring chloroplast ultrastructure. Excess Zn2+ ameliorated the adverse effects of Cd2+ on PSII photochemistry, increasing the fraction of energy used for photochemistry (ΦPSII) and restoring PSII redox state and maximum PSII efficiency (Fv/Fm), while decreasing excess excitation energy at PSII (EXC). We conclude that excess Zn2+ application eliminated the adverse effects of Cd2+ toxicity, reducing Cd2+ uptake and translocation and restoring chloroplast ultrastructure and PSII photochemical efficiency. Thus, excess Zn2+ application can be used as an important method for low Cd2+-accumulating crops, limiting Cd2+ entry into the food chain.\n",

      "Statistical mechanics and molecular dynamics simulations have been carried out to study the distribution and dynamics of internal water molecules in bovine heart cytochrome c oxidase (CcO). CcO is found to be capable of holding plenty of water, which in subunit I alone amounts to about 165 molecules. The dynamic characterization of these water molecules is carried out. The nascent water molecules produced in the redox reaction at the heme a(3)-CuB binuclear site form an intriguing chain structure. The chain begins at the position of Glu242 at the end of the D channel, and has a fork structure, one branch of which leads to the binuclear center, and the other to the propionate d of heme a(3). The branch that leads to the binuclear center has dynamic access both to the site where the formation of water occurs, and to delta-nitrogen of His291. From the binuclear center, the chain continues to run into the K channel. The stability of this hydrogen bond network is examined dynamically. The catalytic site is located at the hydrophobic region, and the nascent water molecules are produced at the top of the energy hill. The energy gradient is utilized as the mechanism of water removal from the protein. The water exit channels are explored using high-temperature dynamics simulations. Two putative channels for water exit from the catalytic site have been identified. One is leading directly toward Mg(2+) site. However, this channel is only open when His291 is dissociated from CuB. If His291 is bound to CuB, the only channel for water exit is the one that originates at E242 and leads toward the middle of the membrane. This is the same channel that is presumably used for oxygen supply.\n",

      " \n",
      "In this study, a fluorescence polarization immunoassay (FPIA) was developed based on the single-chain variable fragments (scFvs) for fumonisin Bs (FBs). The scFvs were prepared from FBs-specific monoclonal antibody secreting hybridomas (4F5 and 4B9). The established FPIA could determine the sum of fumonisin B1 (FB1) and fumonisin B2 (FB2) within a short time. The IC50 of FPIA for the detection of FB1 and FB2 were 29.36 ng/ml and 1,477.82 ng/ml with 4F5 scFv, and 125.16 ng/ml and 30.44 ng/ml with 4B9 scFv, so the 4B9 scFv was selected for detection of FB1 and FB2 in maize samples with a limit of detection of 441.54 μg/kg and 344.933 μg/kg. The recoveries ranged from 84.7 to 104.1% with a coefficient of variation less than 14.1% in spiked samples, and the result of the FPIA method was in good consistency with that of HPLC-MS/MS. To supply a better understanding of the immunoassay results, the interactions mechanism of scFvs-FBs was further revealed by the homology modelling, molecular docking, and molecular dynamic simulation. It was indicated that six complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) were involved in 4B9 scFv recognition, forming a narrow binding cavity, and FB1/FB2 could be inserted into this binding cavity stably through strong hydrogen bonds and other interactions. While in 4F5 scFv, only the FB1 stably inserted in the binding pocket formed by four CDRs through strong hydrogen bonds, and FB2 did not fit the binding cavity due to the lack of hydroxyl at C10, which is the key recognition site of 4F5 scFv. Also, the binding energy of FB2-4B9 scFv complex is higher than the FB2-4F5 scFv complex. This study established a FPIA method with scFv for the detection of FB1 and FB1 in maize, and systematically predicted recognition mechanism of FBs and scFvs, which provided a reference for the better understanding of the immunoassay mechanism.\n",

      " \n",
      "The current models for colorectal cancer (CRC) are essentially linear in nature with a sequential progression from adenoma through to carcinoma. However, these views of CRC development do not explain the full body of published knowledge and tend to discount environmental influences. This paper proposes that CRC is a cellular response to prolonged exposure to cytotoxic agents (e.g., free ammonia) as key events within a sustained high-risk colonic luminal environment. This environment is low in substrate for the colonocytes (short chain fatty acids, SCFA) and consequently of higher pH with higher levels of free ammonia and decreased mucosal oxygen supply as a result of lower visceral blood flow. All of these lead to greater and prolonged exposure of the colonic epithelium to a cytotoxic agent with diminished aerobic energy availability. Normal colonocytes faced with this unfavourable environment can transform into CRC cells for survival through epigenetic reprogramming to express genes which increase mobility to allow migration and proliferation. Recent data with high protein diets confirm that genetic damage can be increased, consistent with greater CRC risk. However, this damage can be reversed by increasing SCFA supply by feeding fermentable fibre as resistant starch or arabinoxylan. High protein, low carbohydrate diets have been shown to alter the colonic environment with lower butyrate levels and apparently greater mucosal exposure to ammonia, consistent with our hypothesis. Evidence is drawn from in vivo and in vitro genomic and biochemical studies to frame experiments to test this proposition.\n",

      "The crystal structures of gastric lipases in the apo form [Roussel, A., et al. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 16995-17002] or in complex with the (R(P))-undecyl butyl phosphonate [C(11)Y(4)(+)] [Roussel, A., et al. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 2266-2274] have improved our understanding of the structure-activity relationships of acid lipases. In this report, we have performed a kinetic study with dog and human gastric lipases (DGL and HGL, respectively) using several phosphonate inhibitors by varying the absolute configuration of the phosphorus atom and the chain length of the alkyl/alkoxy substituents. Using the two previously determined structures and that of a new crystal structure obtained with the other (S(P))-phosphonate enantiomer [C(11)Y(4)(-)], we constructed models of phosphonate inhibitors fitting into the active site crevices of DGL and HGL. All inhibitors with a chain length of fewer than 12 carbon atoms were found to be completely buried in the catalytic crevice, whereas longer alkyl/alkoxy chains were found to point out of the cavity. The main stereospecific determinant explaining the stronger inhibition of the S(P) enantiomers is the presence of a hydrogen bond involving the catalytic histidine as found in the DGL-C(11)Y(4)(-) complex. On the basis of these results, we have built a model of the first tetrahedral intermediate corresponding to the tristearoyl-lipase complex. The triglyceride molecule completely fills the active site crevice of DGL, in contrast with what is observed with other lipases such as pancreatic lipases which have a shallower and narrower active site. For substrate hydrolysis, the supply of water molecules to the active site might be achieved through a lateral channel identified in the protein core.\n",

      " \n",
      "We assume that each class of protein has a core structure that is defined by internal residues, and that the external, solvent-contacting residues contribute to the stability of the structure, are of primary importance to function, but do not determine the architecture of the core portions of the polypeptide chain. An algorithm has been developed to supply a list of permitted sequences of internal residues compatible with a known core structure. This list is referred to as the tertiary template for that structure. In general the positions in the template are not sequentially adjacent and are distributed throughout the polypeptide chain. The template is derived using the fixed positions for the main-chain and beta-carbon atoms in the test structure and selected stereochemical rules. The focus of this paper is on the use of two packing criteria: avoidance of steric overlap and complete filling of available space. The program also notes potential polar group interactions and disulfide bonds as well as possible burial of formal charges. Central to the algorithm is the side-chain rotamer library. In an update of earlier studies by others, we show that 17 of the 20 amino acids (omitting Met, Lys and Arg) can be represented adequately by 67 side-chain rotamers. A list of chi angles and their standard deviations is given. The newer, high-resolution, refined structures in the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank show similar mean chi values, but have much smaller deviations than those of earlier studies. This suggests that a rotamer library may be a better structural approximation than was previously thought. In using packing constraints, it has been found essential to include all hydrogen atoms specifically. The \"unified atom\" representation is not adequate. The permitted rotamer sequences are severely restricted by the main-chain plus beta-carbon atoms of the test structure. Further restriction is introduced if the full set of atoms of the external residues are held fixed, the full-chain model. The space-filling requirement has a major role in restricting the template lists. The preliminary tests reported here make it appear likely that templates prepared from the currently known core structures will be able to discriminate between these structures. The templates should thus be useful in deciding whether a sequence of unknown tertiary structure fits any of the known core classes and, if a fit is found, how the sequence should be aligned in three dimensions to fit the core of that class.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\n",

      "Despite several attempts, incorporating biological detection that supplies necessary biological information into therapeutic nanotheranostics for hypoxic tumor treatments is considered to be in its infancy. It is therefore imperative to consolidate biological detection and desirable phototherapy into a single nanosystem for maximizing theranostic advantages. Herein, we develop a versatile nanoprobe through combined fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) and oxygen-augmenting strategy, namely APT, which enables glycosylation detection, O2 self-sufficiency, and collaborative phototherapy. Such APT nanoprobes were constructed by depositing platinum onto gold nano-bipyramids (Au NBPs), linking FITC fluorophore-labeled AS1411 aptamers for introducing FRET donors, and by conjugating G-quadruplex intercalated with TMPyP4 to their surfaces via the SH-DNA chain. By installing FRET acceptors on the glycan of targeted EpCAM glycoprotein using the metabolic glycan labeling and click chemistry, FRET signals appear on the cancerous cell membranes, not normal cells, when donors and acceptors are within an appropriate distance. This actualizes protein-specific glycosylation visualization while revealing glycan-based changes correlated with tumor progression. Interestingly, the deposited platinum scavenges excessive H2O2 as artificial nanoenzymes to transform O2 that alleviates tumor hypoxia and simultaneously elevates singlet oxygen (1O2) for inducing cancer cell apoptosis. Notably, the significant hyperthermia devastation was elicited via APT nanoprobes with phenomenal photothermal therapy (PTT) efficiency (71.8%) for thermally ablating cancer cells, resulting in synergistically enhanced photodynamic-hyperthermia therapy. Consequently, APT nanoprobes nearly actualized thorough tumor ablation while demonstrating highly curative biosafety. This work offers a new paradigm to rationally explore a combined FRET and oxygen-augmenting strategy with a focus on nanotheranostics for hypoxic tumor elimination.\n",

      "The rheology of carboxymethyl fenugreek gum (CFG) is characterized and applied it as a binder for the silicon anode of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). First, a series of carboxymethyl fenugreek gum (namely CFG-1, CFG-2 and CFG-3) was prepared and characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectrophotometer and hydrogen nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry studies. In rheological measurements, the CFG solutions show higher flowability, weaker viscoelastic behavior and better thixotropy than that of fenugreek gum (FG) solution. Furthermore, the higher degrees of substitution (DS) of CFG solutions lead to lower apparent viscosity and higher flow index, weaker elastic effect and smaller relaxation time, and higher viscosity recoverability than those obtained for lower DS of CFG solutions. In electrochemical measurements, the polar hydroxyl and carboxyl groups in the CFG skeleton chain provide bonding points between the CFG binders and the silicon electrode to produce binder-silicon bonds, which cause strong hydrogen bonding, and resulted in excellent electrochemical stability and specific capacity. The electrochemical performances were measured via the silicon electrodes with FG and CFG at 5 wt% content. As the DS is increased, the initial Coulombic efficiency can increase from 88.74% to 91.3%. When the electrode undergoes a volume change, the CFG binder with silicon electrodes can hold high capacity of above 1500 mAh/g after 200 charge-discharge cycles. Therefore, the carboxymethyl fenugreek gum as a binder may also be a novel extended binder-design, with applications for silicon anodes of LIBs.\n",

      " \n",
      "1. Furazolidone, a nitrofuran antibiotic, was prohibited from the use in food-producing animals in the European Union (EU) in 1997. In 2002, the EU restricted the import of poultry meat and aquaculture species from countries where furazolidone residues had been detected. 2. By 2004, however, residues of the side-chain metabolite, 3-amino-2-oxazolidinone (AOZ) of furazolidone, were detected in chicken meat produced in Northern Ireland. 3. With the random spread of positive results across farms of a single integrated organisation, including organically reared flocks, it seemed unlikely that the source of residues was due to illegal use of the drug, but more likely caused by a source of contamination. 4. Potential sources investigated were as follows: furazolidone contamination of feedstuffs, a \"hot spot\" of furazolidone in poultry houses, contamination occurring within breeding stocks and transferred with the birds to broiler growing houses, and furazolidone contamination of the water supply. 5. Furazolidone contamination was associated with birds reared in houses more than 10 years old. 6. Contamination was traced to the water supply of poultry houses, where un-dissolved furazolidone, legally administered prior to 1997, had settled to the bottom of water storage tanks. It remained un-disturbed until 2004 when the integrator changed the procedure for cleaning water tanks between crops of birds. 7. The use of Proxitane, a hydrogen peroxide disinfectant, caused effervescence within the tank such that small quantities of furazolidone were dissolved, delivered to birds via drinkers and subsequently caused residues in the broiler meat. 8. The environmental impact of the contamination was investigated by testing soil and grass from land adjacent to an organic poultry house to which birds had access. 9. Mechanisms of contamination and how residues may be spread throughout a large integrated poultry system are not restricted to furazolidone. Incidents of contamination are even more likely when using licensed drugs where the drugs may be present on-farm in large quantities.\n",

      " \n",
      "High-efficiency recycling technology for endangered elements effectively mitigates the risk of resource shortages and promises the sustainability of supply chains, which is significant to the industry. In this study, an activated carbon (AC)-based capacitive deionization (CDI) for the selective electrosorption and recovery of indium ions (In3+) from acidic aqueous solution is proposed. The effects of applied voltage, pH, and initial concentration of indium were investigated to optimize the operation parameters for In3+ electrosorption. The results of cyclic voltammetry and the galvanostatic charge/discharge measurements indicate that the AC electrode shows good capability for the electrosorption of In3+ based on electrical double-layer capacitance. As demonstrated, In3+ can be successfully removed by CDI without deposition when the pH < 4, as confirmed by scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. The deionization capacity of In3+ is 7.95 mg/g with an energy consumption of 0.84 kWh/mol in single-pass mode CDI with an initial concentration of 50 mg/L (pH = 3) at 1.2 V. However, the removal of In3+ is affected by the solution pH since hydrogen ions (H+) compete for electrosorption. Note that In3+ ions with high valence are preferentially electrosorbed on the electrode surface over H+ ions, exhibiting a selectivity coefficient of 2.12. Herein, in the charging step, a large number of H+ ions in solution are rapidly electrosorbed onto the electrode, while these H+ ions are gradually replaced by a small number of In3+ ions in solution. Therefore, this electrosorption process shows great potential for effectively recovering indium ions from acidic aqueous solutions.\n",

      " \n",
      "The initial stage of proton propagation in the D-path channel of bovine cytochrome c oxidase, consisting of the approach of an H(+) to the entrance of this specific pathway, is inspected via first-principles calculations. Our model, extracted from the X-ray crystallographic structure, includes the amino acid residue pair aspartate (Asp91) and histidine (His503) as protonatable sites. Our calculations show that an additional proton, corresponding to the H(+) uptake by the enzyme from the inner bulk water, is transferred to either Asp91 or His503, leading to the formation of a neutral or a charge-separated protonation state. The relative stability between the two states amounts to a total energy difference of about 5 kcal/mol; this indicates that both Asp91 and His503 are involved in the proton supply to the D-path, playing the role of proton acceptors. The hydrogen-bond environment around Asp91 and His503 has an important influence on both the energetics and the electronic structure of the system; for instance, it compensates the Coulomb-energy cost in the charge-separated protonation state. An energy partitioning analysis shows that the compensatory effect is mainly due to local electrostatic interactions among the charged Asp91 and His503 side chains and the surrounding polar residues. The energy compensation mechanism we found in this work balances the energetics of Asp-His pairs, hence permitting an efficient and selective regulation of the protonatable amino acid residues, where several protonation states are accessible within energy differences of the order of a few H-bonds.\n",

      " \n",
      "The impact of runoff from sulfuric soils in the heavily drained Cudgen Lake floodplain, eastern Australia on water quality and downstream coastal lake sediments has been examined. The oxidation of sulfidic soils and the transformation into sulfuric soils leads to changes not only in the upper soil profile but also affects drainage water quality and the chemistry of bottom sediments in receiving waters. Oxidation transforms the soil from a sink for sulfur and metals to a significant source for downstream environments. Sulfuric soils within the Cudgen Lake catchment contain 9.18 x 10(5) mol H+ per hectare as well as elevated concentration of metals (e.g. Al, Fe, Mn) and sulfate. These products of sulfidic soil oxidation are transported efficiently from the soil profile by the constructed drainage network and into the downstream lake system. The acid volatile sulfur (AVS), chromium reducible sulfur (CRS), total sulfur, organic carbon, and reactive iron contents present in the solid phase of the lake sediments are reported. The AVS/CRS, DOP and DOS values observed in the lake sediments show that natural monosulfide formation in the near surface sediments has been enhanced due to increased inputs of organic matter, sulfate, ferrous iron and other metals following development of the catchment. There are elevated concentrations of metals (e.g. As, Al, Cd, Cr, Hg, Zn and Pb) in the upper layer of monosulfidic lake sediments compared with the underlying pyritic sediments some of which exceed sediment quality guidelines. These metals could be released by dredging or through re-suspension during high flow conditions or enter the food chain.\n",

      "Human caliciviruses (HuCVs) cause waterborne outbreaks of gastroenteritis. Standard indicators of a safe water supply do not adequately predict contamination of water by viruses, including HuCVs. We developed a method to concentrate and detect HuCVs in water samples by using a cultivable primate calicivirus (Pan-1) as a model. Viable Pan-1 was seeded in different types of water and then filtered with a 1MDS filter, eluted with beef extract (BE), and reconcentrated by polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitation. The viruses in the final samples were tested by plaque assay or by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR following extraction of the RNA with Trizol. Pan-1 was more sensitive to high-pH treatment than poliovirus was; a pH 9.0 BE solution was found to recover 35% more viable Pan-1 than a pH 9.5 BE solution recovered. Pan-1 was recovered from small volumes of deionized, finished, ground, and surface waters at efficiencies of 94, 73, 67, and 64%, respectively, when samples were assayed after elution without further concentration. When larger volumes of water (up to 40 liters) were tested after elution and concentration with PEG, 38, 19, and 14% of the seeded Pan-1 were recovered from finished, ground, and surface waters, respectively. The limit of detection of Pan-1 by RT-PCR was estimated to be 0.75 to 1.5 PFU in 40 liters of finished water. This method may be adapted for monitoring HuCVs in drinking water and other types of water for public health safety.\n",

      "The feasibility of removing algae from water and wastewater by chemical flocculation techniques was investigated. Mixed cultures of algae were obtained from both continuous- and batch-fed laboratory reactors. Representative cationic, anionic, and nonionic synthetic organic polyelectrolytes were used as flocculants. Under the experimental conditions, chemically induced algal flocculation occurred with the addition of cationic polyelectrolyte, but not with anionic or nonionic polymers, although attachment of all polyelectrolyte species to the algal surface is shown. The mechanism of chemically induced algal flocculation is interpreted in terms of bridging phenomena between the discrete algal cells and the linearly extended polymer chains, forming a three-dimensional matrix that is capable of subsiding under quiescent conditions. The degree of flocculation is shown to be a direct function of the extent of polymer coverage of the active sites on the algal surface, although to induce flocculation by this method requires that the algal surface charge must concurrently be reduced to a level at which the extended polymers can bridge the minimal distance of separation imposed by electrostatic repulsion. The influence of pH, algal concentration, and algal growth phase on the requisite cationic flocculant dose is also reported.\n",

      "An increasing human population requires a secure food supply and a cost effective, oral vaccine delivery system for livestock would help facilitate this end. Recombinant antigen adsorbed onto silica beads and coated with myristic acid, was released (∼15% (w/v)) over 24 h at pH 8.8. At pH 2, the myristic acid acted as an enteric coating, protecting the antigen from a variety of proteases. The antigen adsorbed onto silica particles, coated in myristic acid had a conserved secondary structure (measured by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy) following its pH-triggered release. Small angle neutron scattering (SANS) was used to measure the thickness of the adsorbed antigen, finding that its adsorbed conformation was slightly greater than its solution radius of gyration, i.e. 120-160 Å. The addition of myristic acid led to a further increase in particle size, with scattering data consistent with an acid thickness slightly greater than a monolayer of fully extended alkyl chains and a degree of hydration of around 50%. Whilst adsorbed onto the silica and coated in myristic acid, the protein was stable over 14 days at 42 °C, indicating a reduced need for cold chain storage. These data indicate that further investigation is warranted into the development of this technology.\n",

      "A weak anion exchange (WAX) chromatography method coupled to online UV and NMR detection was developed for the separation and structural identification of heparin impurities. This work describes the separation of dermatan sulfate, chondroitin sulfate A, heparin, and the semisynthetic fully sulfated chondroitin sulfate, FSCS, through a displacement-based mechanism. The WAX separation requires significantly less salt than comparable strong anion exchange chromatography, facilitating NMR detection using a standard commercially produced flow probe. Retention and elution of both heparin and FSCS were found to be highly dependent on pH/pD and salt concentration. The elution time of each analyte could be controlled simply by adjusting a delay prior to introduction of the appropriate salt concentration, with little impact of the extent of the delay on chromatographic peak shape. Both on-flow and stop-flow proton ((1)H) NMR spectra were acquired to monitor and identify eluting components following separation. The approach described for the online separation of heparin and its potential impurities adds to the arsenal of techniques available for the rapid identification of new natural and/or intentional contaminants that may be introduced into the heparin supply chain.\n",

Here we studied the defense responses in soybean roots exposed to ions of cadmium (applied as 50 mg l−1 Cd2+) when combined with an excessive dose of N in form of NH4NO3. Our data indicate that despite of stunted root growth, several stress symptoms typically observed upon cadmium treatment, e.g. peroxidation of lipid membranes or activation of chitinase isoforms, become suppressed at highly excessive N. At the same time, other defense mechanisms such as catalases and proline accumulation were elevated. Most importantly, the interplay of ongoing responses resulted in a decreased uptake of the metal into the root tissue. This report points to the complexity of plant defense responses under conditions of heavy metal pollution combined with intensive fertilization in agriculture.\n",

The specific spoilage organisms of these products were lactic acid bacteria (LAB), which dominated during storage, while yeasts, whenever present, remained at low levels (1 to 2 log CFU/g). Correlations of LAB populations with changes in pH and sensory characteristics indicated that the spoilage level of LAB ranged from 8.1 to 8.6 log CFU/g for both products. TK showed a relatively higher microbial stability than did TS. The growth of LAB was modeled with the Baranyi model, while their maximum specific growth rates were further modeled as a function of temperature with square-root model and Arrhenius equations for each appetizer. The validation of the model was performed under nonisothermal conditions in the laboratory and in a field validation trial with temperature logging during distribution of individual packages in the chill supply chain, including transportation from the plant to the distribution center, retail display, and household refrigerators. Models for both appetizers showed satisfactory agreement with data, with a slight tendency of overprediction of LAB in TS. The field validation process also confirmed the higher stability of TK over TS. The developed models may serve as a useful tool for monitoring the microbiological quality of such complex products and manage their distribution. Furthermore, depending on the seasonal variation of chill chain conditions, reassessment of shelf life may be performed.\n",

      " \n",
      "The use of microorganisms or toxins as weapons of death and fear is not a novel concept; however, the modes by which these agents of bioterrorism are deployed are increasingly clever and insidious. One mechanism by which biothreats are readily disseminated is through a nation's food supply. Ricin, a toxin derived from the castor bean plant, displays a strong thermostability and remains active at acidic and alkaline pHs. Therefore, the CDC has assigned ricin as a category B reagent since it may be easily amendable as a deliberate food biocontaminate. Current tools for ricin detection utilize enzymatic activity, immunointeractions and presence of castor bean DNA. Many of these tools are confounded by complex food matrices, display a limited dynamic range of detection and/or lack specificity. Aptamers, short RNA and single stranded DNA sequences, have increased affinity to their selected receptors, experience little cross-reactivity to other homologous compounds and are currently being sought after as biosensors for bacterial contaminants in food. This paper describes the selection and characterization of a single, dominant aptamer, designated as SSRA1, against the B-chain of ricin. SSRA1 displays one folding conformation that is stable across 4-63 °C (ΔG = -5.05). SSRA1 is able to concentrate at least 30 ng mL(-1) of ricin B chain from several liquid food matrices and outcompetes a currently available ELISA kit and ricin aptamer. Furthermore, we show detection of 25 ng mL(-1) of intact ricin A-B complex using SSRA1 combined with surface enhanced Raman scattering technique. Thus, SSRA1 would serve well as pre-analytical tool for processing of ricin from liquid foods to aid current diagnostics as well as a sensor for direct ricin detection.\n",

      "Tissue damage caused by excessive amounts of neutrophil-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) occurs in many inflammatory diseases. Butyrate is a short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) with known anti-inflammatory properties, able to modulate several neutrophil functions. Evidence is provided here that butyrate inhibits neutrophil ROS release in a dose and time-dependent fashion. Given the short half-life of butyrate, chitosan/hyaluronan nanoparticles are next designed and developed as controlled release carriers able to provide cells with a long-lasting supply of this SCFA. Notably, while the inhibition of neutrophil ROS production by free butyrate declines over time, that of butyrate-loaded chitosan/hyaluronan nanoparticles (B-NPs) is sustained. Additional valuable features of these nanoparticles are inherent ROS scavenger activity, resistance to cell internalization, and mucoadhesiveness. B-NPs appear as promising tools to limit ROS-dependent tissue injury during inflammation. Particularly, by virtue of their mucoadhesiveness, B-NPs administered by enema can be effective in the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases.\n",

      "Here we show that N₂ gas plasma, produced by applying a short high-voltage pulse using a static induction (SI) thyristor power supply inactivates influenza virus. N₂ gas plasma treatment of influenza A and B viruses induced the degradation of viral proteins, including nucleoprotein, hemagglutinin, and neuraminidase. The injury of viral RNA genome and the inactivation of hemagglutination were also observed after N₂ gas plasma treatment. These changes were possibly due to changes in the viral envelope, because modification of the lipid content was also suggested by Fourier-transformed infrared spectroscopy. At least three major mechanisms of action (heat, UV-A, and oxidative stress (i.e. hydrogen peroxide-like molecules)) were found in this system. Among them, oxidative stress appeared to be the main factor in the inactivation of influenza virus. In addition, there was an increase in the nitrotyrosine content of viral proteins, suggesting that oxidative stress produced by N₂ gas plasma generation oxidized proteins. As a result, oxidation may be the most important factor in the inactivation, degradation, and modification of influenza virus by N₂ gas plasma.\n",

      "Rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton is integral to cell shape and function. Actin-binding proteins, e.g., filamin, can naturally contribute to the mechanics and function of the actin cytoskeleton. The molecular mechanical bases for filamin's function in actin cytoskeletal reorganization are examined here using molecular dynamics simulations. Simulations are performed by applying forces ranging from 25 pN to 125 pN for 2.5 ns to the rod domain of filamin. Applying small loads ( approximately 25 pN) to filamin's rod domain supplies sufficient energy to alter the conformation of the N-terminal regions of the rod. These forces break local hydrogen bond coordination often enough to allow side chains to find new coordination partners, in turn leading to drastic changes in the conformation of filamin, for example, increasing the hydrophobic character of the N-terminal rod region and, alternatively, activating the C-terminal region to become increasingly stiff. These changes in conformation can lead to changes in the affinity of filamin for its binding partners. Therefore, filamin can function to transduce mechanical signals as well as preserve topology of the actin cytoskeleton throughout the rod domain.\n",

      "The role of several active site residues of alpha-chymotrypsin in the prototypical refolding transition between active and inactive forms of this enzyme is examined using chemical modification. Oxidation of Met-192 to the sulfoxide results in a derivative which remains entirely in an active state from pH 6 to 9. The derivative becomes inactive only at high pH with pKa = 10.3, delta H0 = 9.5 kcal and delta S0 = -15 eu., indicating the sulfoxide group supplies about 2.1 kcal of active state stabilization relative to the unoxidized methionine side chain. The refolding transition of N-methyl-His-57-alpha-chymotrypsin, in which a nitrogen of the \"charge relay\" histidine is methylated, displays one ionization process with an apparent pKa of 9.45. The absence of an additional ionization process with a pKa near 7 provides evidence that one of the ionizations in the six state mechanism which describes this transition in alpha-chymotrypsin is linked to the charge relay system. We also demonstrate, using alpha-chymotrypsin, Met-192-sulfoxide-alpha-chymotrypsin and N-methyl-His-57-alpha-chymotrypsin, that the 230 nm circular dichroism band is a quantitative probe of the active-inactive equilibrium, although the chromophore or chromophores responsible for this and another very large negative band at 202 nm have not been identified. Circular dichroism was used to observe the active-inactive equilibrium in methan sulfonyl-alpha-chymotrypsin and phenylmethane sulfonyl-alpha-chymotrypsin. The enhanced stability of the active state of these derivatives relative to alpha-chymotrypsin can be rationalized in terms of steric effects in the substrate side chain binding site.\n",

The parameters of the mathematical model of phosphorylating mitochondria were derived from experimental data. The model correctly described the competition between ATP utilization inside and outside mitochondria for the ATP generated in mitochondria. On the basis of the good agreement between experiments and simulations, the contribution of different steps to the control of respiration was estimated by computing their control strengths, i.e., the influence of their activities on the rate of respiration. The rate-controlling influences vary depending on the load of oxidative phosphorylation. The predominant steps are: in the fully active state (State 3)--the hydrogen supply to the respiratory chain; in the resting state (State 4)--the proton leak of the mitochondrial inner membrane; in states of non-maximum ATP export--the adenine nucleotide translocator. Titrations of respiration with phenylsuccinate, antimycin, oligomycin and carboxyatractyloside completely support these conclusions.\n",

      "Aging compromises restoration of the cardiac mechanical function during reperfusion. We hypothesized that this was due to an ampler release of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS). This study aimed at characterising ex vivo the mitochondrial ROS release during reperfusion in isolated perfused hearts of middle-aged rats. Causes and consequences on myocardial function of the observed changes were then evaluated. The hearts of rats aged 10- or 52-week old were subjected to global ischemia followed by reperfusion. Mechanical function was monitored throughout the entire procedure. Activities of the respiratory chain complexes and the ratio of aconitase to fumarase activities were determined before ischemia and at the end of reperfusion. H2O2 release was also evaluated in isolated mitochondria. During ischemia, middle-aged hearts displayed a delayed contracture, suggesting a maintained ATP production but also an increased metabolic proton production. Restoration of the mechanical function during reperfusion was however reduced in the middle-aged hearts, due to lower recovery of the coronary flow associated with higher mitochondrial oxidative stress indicated by the aconitase to fumarase ratio in the cardiac tissues. Surprisingly, activity of the respiratory chain complex II was better maintained in the hearts of middle-aged animals, probably because of an enhanced preservation of its membrane lipid environment. This can explain the higher mitochondrial oxidative stress observed in these conditions, since cardiac mitochondria produce much more H2O2 when they oxidize FADH2-linked substrates than when they use NADH-linked substrates. In conclusion, the lower restoration of the cardiac mechanical activity during reperfusion in the middle-aged hearts was due to an impaired recovery of the coronary flow and an insufficient oxygen supply. The deterioration of the coronary perfusion was explained by an increased mitochondrial ROS release related to the preservation of complex II activity during reperfusion.\n",

      "The energy-dependent uptake of calcium by inverted membrane vesicles of Escherichia coli was investigated. Methods for preparation and storage of the vesicles were devised to allow for the maximal activity and stability of the calcium transport system. The pH and temperature optima for the reaction were observed to occur at pH 8.0 AND 30 DEGREES, RESPECTIVELY. The eft was found that the extent of the reaction depended on the presence of phosphate or oxalate. Phosphate was found to enter the vesicles at a rate slower than that of calcium. A Ca2+:Pi ratio of approximately 1.5 was found, suggesting formation of Ca3(PO4)2. Monovalent cations stimulated calcium uptake, with the order of effectiveness being K+ is greater than Na+ is greater than Li+ is greater than NH4+. Inhibition was found with certain divalent cations, but these also inhibited the electron transport chain. Of the divalent cations examined only Mg2+ and Sr2+ inhibited calcium transport without a corresponding inhibition of respiration. Calcium transport exhibited biphasic Kinetics, with a low affinity system and a high affinity system. The low affinity system showed a Km of 0.34 mM and a Vmax of 85 nmol/min/mg of protein. The kinetic constants of the high affinity system were 4.5 muM and 2 nmol/min/mg of protein. The energy for calcium transport could be derived from the electron transport chain by oxidation of NADH, D-lactate, and succinate, in order of their effectiveness. Respiration-driven calcium transport was inhibited by inhibitors of the electron transport chain and by uncouplers of oxidative phosphorylation. ATP could also be used to supply enerty for calcium transport. The ATP-driven reaction was inhibited by inhibitors of the Mg2+ATPase and by an antiserum prepared against that protein, demonstrating that that enzyme is involved in the utilization of ATP for active transport in inverted vesicles.\n",

      "Apart from substrate functions, a signaling role of sucrose in root growth regulation is well established. This raised the question whether sucrose signals might also be involved in formation of cluster-roots (CRs) under phosphate (Pi) limitation, mediating exudation of phosphorus (P)-mobilizing root exudates, e.g. in Lupinus albus and members of the Proteaceae. Earlier studies demonstrated that CR formation in L. albus was mimicked to some extent by external application of high sucrose concentrations (25 mM) in the presence of extremely high P supply (1-10 mM), usually suppressing CR formation. In this study, we re-addressed this question using an axenic hydroponic culture system with normal P supply (0.1 mM) and a range of sucrose applications (0.25-25 mM). The 2.5 mM sucrose concentration was comparable with internal sucrose levels in the zone of CR initiation in first-order laterals of P-deficient plants (3.4 mM) and induced the same CR morphology. Similar to earlier studies, high sucrose concentrations (25 mM) resulted in root thickening and inhibition of root elongation, associated with a 10-fold increase of the internal sucrose level. The sucrose analog palatinose and a combination of glucose/fructose failed to stimulate CR formation under P-sufficient conditions, demonstrating a signal function of sucrose and excluding osmotic or carbon source effects. In contrast to earlier findings, sucrose was able to induce CR formation but had no effect on CR functioning with respect to citrate exudation, in vitro activity and expression of genes encoding phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase, secretory acid phosphatase and MATE transporters, mediating P-mobilizing functions of CRs.\n",

      "The mitochondrial ferrochelatase activity has been studied in coupled rat liver mitochondria using deuteroporphyrin IX (incorporated into liposomes of lecithin) and Fe(III) or Co(II) as the substrates. 1. It was found that respiring mitochondria catalyze the insertion of Fe(II) and Co(II) into deuteroporphyrin. When Fe(III) was used as the metal donor, the reaction revealed an absolute requirement for a supply of reducing equivalents supported by the respiratory chain. 2. A close correlation was found between the disappearance of porphyrin and the formation of heme which allows an accurate estimate of the extinction coefficient for the porphyrin to heme conversion. The value deltae (mM-1 - cm-1) = 3.5 for the wavelength pair 498 509 nm, is considerably lower than previously reported. 3. The maximal rate of deuteroheme synthesis was found to be approx. 1 nM - min-1 - mg-1 of protein at 37 degrees C, PH 7.4 and optimal substrate concentrations, i.e. 75 muM Fe(III) and 50 muM deuteroporphyrin. 4. Provided the mitochondria are supplemented with an oxidizable substrate, the presence of oxygen has no effect on the rate of deuteroheme synthesis.\n",

      " \n",
      "Packaged drinking water (PW) sold in bottles and plastic bags/sachets is widely consumed in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), and many urban users in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) rely on packaged sachet water (PSW) as their primary source of water for consumption. However, few rigorous studies have investigated PSW quality in SSA, and none have compared PSW to stored household water for consumption (HWC). A clearer understanding of PSW quality in the context of alternative sources is needed to inform policy and regulation. As elsewhere in SSA, PSW is widely consumed in Sierra Leone, but government oversight is nearly nonexistent. This study examined the microbiological and chemical quality of a representative sample of PSW products in Freetown, Sierra Leone at packaged water manufacturing facilities (PWMFs) and at points of sale (POSs). Samples of HWC were also analyzed for comparison. The study did not find evidence of serious chemical contamination among the parameters studied. However, 19% of 45 PSW products sampled at the PWMF contained detectable Escherichia coli (EC), although only two samples exceeded 10 CFU/100 mL. Concentrations of total coliforms (TC) in PSW (but not EC) increased along the supply chain. Samples of HWC from 60 households in Freetown were significantly more likely to contain EC and TC than PSW at the point of production (p<0.01), and had significantly higher concentrations of both bacterial indicators (p<0.01). These results highlight the need for additional PSW regulation and surveillance, while demonstrating the need to prioritize the safety of HWC. At present, PSW may be the least unsafe option for many households.\n",

      "10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005588\n",
      " \n",
      "Lipids are main fuels for cellular energy and mitochondria their major oxidation site. Yet unknown is to what extent the fuel role of lipids is influenced by their uncoupling effects, and how this affects mitochondrial energetics, redox balance and the emission of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Employing a combined experimental-computational approach, we comparatively analyze β-oxidation of palmitoyl CoA (PCoA) in isolated heart mitochondria from Sham and streptozotocin (STZ)-induced type 1 diabetic (T1DM) guinea pigs (GPs). Parallel high throughput measurements of the rates of oxygen consumption (VO2) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) emission as a function of PCoA concentration, in the presence of L-carnitine and malate, were performed. We found that PCoA concentration < 200 nmol/mg mito protein resulted in low H2O2 emission flux, increasing thereafter in Sham and T1DM GPs under both states 4 and 3 respiration with diabetic mitochondria releasing higher amounts of ROS. Respiratory uncoupling and ROS excess occurred at PCoA > 600 nmol/mg mito prot, in both control and diabetic animals. Also, for the first time, we show that an integrated two compartment mitochondrial model of β-oxidation of long-chain fatty acids and main energy-redox processes is able to simulate the relationship between VO2 and H2O2 emission as a function of lipid concentration. Model and experimental results indicate that PCoA oxidation and its concentration-dependent uncoupling effect, together with a partial lipid-dependent decrease in the rate of superoxide generation, modulate H2O2 emission as a function of VO2. Results indicate that keeping low levels of intracellular lipid is crucial for mitochondria and cells to maintain ROS within physiological levels compatible with signaling and reliable energy supply.\n",

      "10.1094/mpmi-21-5-0622\n",
      " \n",
      "Nitrogen fixation (NF) in legume nodules is very sensitive to environmental constraints. Nodule sucrose synthase (SS; EC 2.4.1.13) has been suggested to play a crucial role in those circumstances because its downregulation leads to an impaired glycolytic carbon flux and, therefore, a depletion of carbon substrates for bacteroids. In the present study, the likelihood of SS being regulated by oxidative signaling has been addressed by the in vivo supply of paraquat (PQ) to nodulated pea plants and the in vitro effects of oxidizing and reducing agents on nodule SS. PQ produced cellular redox imbalance leading to an inhibition of NF. This was preceded by the downregulation of SS gene expression, protein content, and activity. In vitro, oxidizing agents were able to inhibit SS activity and this inhibition was completely reversed by the addition of dithiothreitol. The overall results are consistent with a regulation model of nodule SS exerted by the cellular redox state at both the transcriptional and post-translational levels. The importance of such mechanisms for the regulation of NF in response to environmental stresses are discussed.\n",

      " \n",
      "Microbial metabolism is essential in maintaining a healthy mucosa in the large bowel, preferentially through butyrate specific mechanisms. This system depends on starch supply. Two structurally different resistant starches type 3 (RS3) have been investigated with respect to their resistance to digestion, fermentability, and their effects on the composition and turnover of bile acids in rats. RSA (a mixture of retrograded maltodextrins and branched high molecular weight polymers), which is more resistant than RSB (a retrograded potato starch), increased the rate of fermentation accompanied by a decrease of pH in cecum, colon, and feces. Because they were bound to RS3, less bile acids were reabsorbed, resulting in a higher turnover through the large bowel. Because of the rise of volume, the bile acid level was unchanged and the formation of secondary bile acids was partly suppressed. The results proved a strong relation between RS3, short chain fatty acid production, and microflora. However, butyrate specific benefits are only achieved by an intake of RS3 that result in good fermentation properties, which depend on the kind of the resistant starch structures.\n",

      "The cytochrome P450 enzyme lanosterol 14α-demethylase (LDM) is the target of the azole antifungals used widely in medicine and agriculture as prophylaxis or treatments of infections or diseases caused by fungal pathogens. These drugs and agrochemicals contain an imidazole, triazole or tetrazole substituent, with one of the nitrogens in the azole ring coordinating as the sixth axial ligand to the LDM heme iron. Structural studies show that this membrane bound enzyme contains a relatively rigid ligand binding pocket comprised of a deeply buried heme-containing active site together with a substrate entry channel and putative product exit channel that reach to the membrane. Within the ligand binding pocket the azole antifungals have additional affinity determining interactions with hydrophobic side-chains, the polypeptide backbone and via water-mediated hydrogen bond networks. This review will describe the tools that can be used to identify and characterise the next generation of antifungals targeting LDM, with the goal of obtaining highly potent broad-spectrum fungicides that will be able to avoid target and drug efflux mediated antifungal resistance.\n",

      "Carbohydrates are highly abundant biomolecules found extensively in nature. Besides playing important roles in energy storage and supply, they often serve as essential biosynthetic precursors or structural elements needed to sustain all forms of life. A number of unusual sugars that have certain hydroxyl groups replaced by a hydrogen, an amino group, or an alkyl side chain play crucial roles in determining the biological activity of the parent natural products in bacterial lipopolysaccharides or secondary metabolite antibiotics. Recent investigation of the biosynthesis of these monosaccharides has led to the identification of the gene clusters whose protein products facilitate the unusual sugar formation from the ubiquitous NDP-glucose precursors. This review summarizes the mechanistic studies of a few enzymes crucial to the biosynthesis of C-2, C-3, C-4, and C-6 deoxysugars, the characterization and mutagenesis of nucleotidyl transferases that can recognize and couple structural analogs of their natural substrates and the identification of glycosyltransferases with promiscuous substrate specificity. Information gleaned from these studies has allowed pathway engineering, resulting in the creation of new macrolides with unnatural deoxysugar moieties for biological activity screening. This represents a significant progress toward our goal of searching for more potent agents against infectious diseases and malignant tumors.\n",

      " \n",
      "Microbial extracellular electron uptake (EEU) from solid electron donors has critical implications for microbial energy acquisition in energy-limited environments as well as electrochemical microbial technologies. Although EEU supplies sufficient energy to support cellular growth, additional soluble electron donors are required for most microbes to grow on electrode surfaces. Here, we demonstrated that the minimization of exogenous and endogenous oxidative stress greatly enhanced the growth rate of the sediment EEU-capable sulfate-reducing bacterium Desulfovibrio ferrophilus IS5 on an electrode without the addition of a soluble electron donor. Single-cell activity analysis by nanoscale secondary ion mass spectrometry showed that the metabolic activity of IS5 cells on the electrode was significantly enhanced following incubation in an H-type reactor, which was configured to reduce the exposure of cells to the potential oxidative stress source of the Pt counter electrode (CE). Additionally, the highest metabolic activity was observed at an electrode potential of -0.4 V (versus the standard hydrogen electrode), where electron uptake rate was not at peak. Compared to a single-chamber reactor, incubation in an H-type reactor at -0.4 V shortened the cell doubling time by 50-fold, which resulted in sufficient anabolism for cell replication (15N/Ntotal > 50%). The production of strongly oxidizing species at the CE was confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry analyses. Transcriptome analysis revealed overexpression of antioxidative genes in cells incubated at a potential with higher current production. These results suggested that higher levels of endogenous oxidative species were produced by a more reduced electron-transport chain from trace amounts of oxygen in the reactor, thereby lowering cell activity. In conclusion, EEU may enable sediment microbes to undergo enhanced cell growth and to find niches on minerals under anaerobic energy-limited conditions, where oxidative stress is much less likely to be present.\n",

      "10.1186/1471-2164-13-690\n",
      " \n",
      "BackgroundThe bacterium Pelobacter carbinolicus is able to grow by fermentation, syntrophic hydrogen/formate transfer, or electron transfer to sulfur from short-chain alcohols, hydrogen or formate; it does not oxidize acetate and is not known to ferment any sugars or grow autotrophically. The genome of P. carbinolicus was sequenced in order to understand its metabolic capabilities and physiological features in comparison with its relatives, acetate-oxidizing Geobacter species.ResultsPathways were predicted for catabolism of known substrates: 2,3-butanediol, acetoin, glycerol, 1,2-ethanediol, ethanolamine, choline and ethanol. Multiple isozymes of 2,3-butanediol dehydrogenase, ATP synthase and [FeFe]-hydrogenase were differentiated and assigned roles according to their structural properties and genomic contexts. The absence of asparagine synthetase and the presence of a mutant tRNA for asparagine encoded among RNA-active enzymes suggest that P. carbinolicus may make asparaginyl-tRNA in a novel way. Catabolic glutamate dehydrogenases were discovered, implying that the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle can function catabolically. A phosphotransferase system for uptake of sugars was discovered, along with enzymes that function in 2,3-butanediol production. Pyruvate:ferredoxin/flavodoxin oxidoreductase was identified as a potential bottleneck in both the supply of oxaloacetate for oxidation of acetate by the TCA cycle and the connection of glycolysis to production of ethanol. The P. carbinolicus genome was found to encode autotransporters and various appendages, including three proteins with similarity to the geopilin of electroconductive nanowires.ConclusionsSeveral surprising metabolic capabilities and physiological features were predicted from the genome of P. carbinolicus, suggesting that it is more versatile than anticipated.\n",

The use of antimicrobial compounds is one practical approach for controlling pathogen survival and growth in foods. The goal of this study was to use fluid milk as a model system to identify listeristatic or listericidal treatments that show promise for application in fluid milk and for further evaluation in other dairy products (e.g., cheese). Caprylic acid (CA), ε-polylysine (EPL), hydrogen peroxide, lauric arginate (LAE), and sodium caprylate (SC) were added individually or in combination to whole milk inoculated with L. monocytogenes at ˜4 log10 cfu/mL. Samples were stored at 7°C for 21 d, and L. monocytogenes counts were determined weekly. Inhibitory concentrations of LAE (800 mg/L) and EPL (100-400 mg/L), as well as SC and CA (3,200 mg/L each), were identified. The addition of EPL at 800 mg/L reduced L. monocytogenes counts by >3 log10 cfu/mL from initial inoculation levels after 21 d. Addition of hydrogen peroxide to milk reduced counts by >3 log10 cfu/mL from initial inoculation within 24 h (400 and 800 mg/L) or by d 7 (200 mg/L). Although the combinatory treatments of EPL + CA, EPL + LAE, and LAE + SC were characterized as indifferent, EPL + SC worked synergistically to reduce L. monocytogenes populations in milk over 21 d. Overall, these data identify potential antimicrobial treatments to control L. monocytogenes in milk and serve as a foundation for the continued development of antimicrobial controls for L. monocytogenes in dairy products.\n",

It is first line of defense not only from COVID-19 but also from other infectious diseases caused by deadly pathogens such as cholera, hepatitis, tuberculosis, polio, etc. Absence of any particular vaccine or treatment let World Health Organization (WHO) recommend to the public to maintain social distancing along with regularly washing their hands with soap, sanitize their hands (where washing is not possible), and disinfect their belongings and buildings to avoid the infection. Out of various formulations available in the market, WHO has recommended alcohol-based hand sanitizers, which mainly comprise of ethanol, isopropyl alcohols, and hydrogen peroxides in different combinations due to their high potential to kill the broad range of pathogens including bacterial, viral, fungal, helminthes, etc. Therefore, alcohol-based sanitizers are in high demand since centuries to prevent infection from pathogenic diseases. Ethanol is the most common and popular alcohol in terms of vanishing wide range of pathogens, convenient to use and its production. Ethanol is produced worldwide and is used in various sectors, e.g., beauty and cosmetics, food and beverages, and as the most demanding gasoline additive. The present review is focused on the ethanol production in India, its diversified applications emphasizing hand sanitizers with discussions on formulation of sanitizer and disinfectants, and viability of lignocellulosic and food grain–based ethanol. The review article also emphasizes on the technological details of 1G and 2G ethanol production, their associated challenges, and inputs for the improved ethanol yields so as to strengthen the supply chain of ethanol in India, and making “Atmanirbhar Bharat” (Self-reliant India) campaign of Indian government successfully viable.\n",

      " \n",
      "Bladder carcinoma is the most expensive tumor type to treat on a cost-per-patient basis from diagnosis to death. Treatment with Bacillus Calmette Guerin (BCG) instillation is the only approved immunotherapy in the clinic for the remission of superficial bladder carcinoma. Unfortunately, frequent relapses, high local morbidity, risk of systemic mycobacterial infection, and occasional supply chain interruptions limit the utility of BCG for bladder cancer treatment. It is well known that BCG utilizes an adhesin protein known as fibronectin attachment protein that possesses a crucial RWFV peptide sequence for binding to the bladder tumor microenvironment prior to the initiation of the immunotherapeutic response. We report a RWFV-targeted, pH-responsive stabilized lipid nucleic acid nanoparticle (LNP) vehicle for the effective delivery of an immunotherapeutic oligonucleotide, CpG, that is assembled using a glass microfluidic Chemtrix 3221 reactor. Our small-angle X-ray scattering studies revealed a layer-by-layer assembly of the oligonucleotides with a repeat distance of 6.04 nm within the LNP. Using flow cytometry to evaluate the different cell types found in the bladder tumor microenvironment, RWFV-targeted LNPs were found to attach specifically to fibronectin-secreting cells in culture during a 2 h incubation period. The trafficking and cellular fate of these targeted LNPs were revealed by confocal microscopy of RAW264.7 macrophages to enter the endocytotic pathway within 4 h post treatment. Importantly, control studies reveal that only the pH-sensitive LNP formulation is capable of efficiently releasing the payload within 12 h. As a result, the targeted pH-sensitive LNP resulted in higher expression levels of costimulatory molecules CD83, CD 86, and MHC II, while also inducing higher levels of TNF-α secretion from macrophages. These results demonstrate that RWFV-targeted, pH-sensitive LNP formulations are capable of maximum immunotherapeutic response, potentially making them a highly efficient, lower risk, and readily manufactured alternative to BCG immunotherapy.\n",

      "This study investigated the role of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the neoangiogenesis induced in heart in response to hypoxia. The time-course of adaptive changes in capillary supply, expression of VEGF mRNA and protein was studied in right (RV) and left ventricles (LV) of rats exposed to hypobaric hypoxia during 1-25 days (barometric pressure = 505 hPa). VEGF mRNA levels encoding for VEGF 188 and 164 isoforms were measured by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and VEGF protein was determined by Western blotting. Relative RV weight (i.e., weight of RV related to body weight) increased with hypoxia and was 102% higher than in controls after 15 days of exposure (P < 0.01), while relative LV weight remained unaltered. A rapid and transient increase in VEGF 188 mRNA occurred after 1 day of hypoxia in LV (P < 0.05). Thereafter, a delayed increase in VEGF 188 mRNA expression occurred in RV (ANOVA, P < 0.001). By day 18, VEGF 188 mRNA level was higher in hypoxic than in control rats (P < 0.005) and then decreased to base line levels. Hypoxia did not affect the expression of VEGF 164 mRNA neither in LV nor in RV. One of the main results was that these hypoxia-induced alterations in VEGF transcripts were not followed by associated increase in VEGF protein. These results suggest that capillary growth observed in RV after prolonged exposure to ambient hypoxia likely results from other molecular mechanisms than VEGF.\n",

      " \n",
      "OBJECTIVE: The study was aimed at evaluating the effect of prolonged refrigeration of fresh human milk (HM) on its fatty acid profile, free fatty acid content, lipase activities, and oxidative status. METHODS: HM from mothers of preterm newborns was collected, pooled, and placed in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) refrigerator. Pooled milk was aliquoted and analyzed within 3 hours of collection, and after 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours of storage. The milk samples were analyzed for pH, total and free fatty acid profile, lipase activity at room temperature and at 4°C, lipase activity at room temperature in presence of sodium cholate (bile salt-dependent lipase), total antioxidant capacity, thiobarbituric acid reactive species, malondialdehyde, and conjugated diene concentration. The experiment was replicated in 3 independent trials. RESULTS: Prolonged refrigeration did not affect the fatty acid composition of breast milk, and preserved both its overall oxidative status and the activity of HM lipolytic enzymes. In particular, bile salt-dependent lipase activity, long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, and medium-chain saturated fatty acid concentrations were unaffected for up to 96 hours of refrigerated storage. CONCLUSIONS: Prolonged refrigeration of fresh HM for 96 hours maintained its overall lipid composition. The limited lipolysis during storage should be ascribed to the activity of lipoprotein lipase, responsible for the decrease in pH. Our study demonstrates that infants who receive expressed milk stored for up to 96 hours receive essentially the same supply of fatty acids and active lipases as do infants fed directly at the breast.\n",

      "Microbial communities from soil and groundwater of oil-contaminated sites (Beelitzhof in Berlin-Nikolassee and the former Pintsch site in Hanau, both in Germany) were characterized by description of the physiological potential of arbitrary samples of 48 aerobic heterotrophic bacterial isolates. It was demonstrated that the sum of metabolic abilities, presented as a percentage of substrate-degrading microorganisms in a sample, is both site specific and reproducible. The percentage of hydrocarbon-degrading microorganisms in the communities was most strongly influenced by the diversity and amount of carbon supply (whereas after addition of mineral salts, total cell counts increased). For example, in groundwater of the waste oil-contaminated Pintsch site, only the accessible short-chain alkanes up to dodecane could be metabolized. After dosing with hydrogen peroxide, long-chain alkane-degrading bacteria were found in significant amounts among the predominant microorganisms, which was apparently due to a solubilization effect that brought the longer alkanes (and their degraders) into the groundwater. Because the addition of precultured organisms to a soil-composting windrow had no effect on the degradation pattern of its microbiota, the carbon sources available probably determined whether allochthonous bacteria would become indigenous. Although the physiological potentials of the individual bacteria complemented each other and thus determined the distinctive profile characteristic of the microbial community, the individual members could differ in their metabolic abilities, as was shown by the distribution of positive test results in different samples, and they could also differ in their taxonomic status. Evidently, the taxonomic status of the bacteria did not determine their activities: Strains of the same species showed different degradation abilities for hydrocarbon substrates. However, the taxonomic status of isolates seemed to be highly dependent on the physicochemical factors of a site (soil structure, water capacity, etc.).\n",

      " \n",
      "The long-term relationship between the peripheral nerve trunk and its vascular supply, the vasa nervorum, has not been considered in the context of denervation and regeneration. While the microvessels of peripheral nerve are not thought to influence Wallerian degeneration itself, in this work we explored how vasa nervorum respond to denervation of the nerve trunk. Our hypotheses were that the presence of axons had a significant impact on the vasa nervorum and that the absence of reinnervation might eventually lead to an unfavorable ischemic regenerative microenvironment. We studied rat sciatic nerve trunks for up to 6 months following transection and either prevented regeneration or allowed it to proceed. Vasa nervorum were studied in several ways: (i) measurements of local endoneurial blood flow using microelectrode hydrogen clearance polarography; (ii) measurements of erythrocyte flux (flow) in the extrinsic nerve plexus using laser Doppler flowmetry; (iii) India ink perfusion of microvessels in unfixed nerve; (iv) mRNA expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Early after injury, there were rises in endoneurial and extrinsic flow, microvessel numbers, and VEGF mRNA expression. Angiogenesis was apparently confined to the epineurial and perineurial compartments. Later, however, there were substantial declines in flow observed in long-term (6-month) denervated sciatic nerve trunks associated with declines in the caliber of new microvessels. Reinnervated sciatic nerves had restored endoneurial blood flow. The findings confirm important relationships between axon presence and local blood flow. Angiogenesis is a feature of the injured peripheral nerve, but long term denervated nerve trunks have declines of flow despite retaining new microvessels.\n",

      "We have previously described () that Escherichia coli maintains a balanced supply of deoxyribonucleotides by a regulatory mechanism that up-regulates the levels of ribonucleotide reductase with the lack of its main hydrogen donors thioredoxin, glutaredoxin 1, and glutathione (GSH). By using a semi-quantitative reverse transcription/multiplex polymerase chain reaction fluorescent procedure that enables simultaneous analysis of up to seven mRNA species, we now demonstrate that regulation operates at the transcriptional level. Double mutant cells lacking both thioredoxin and glutaredoxin 1 had increased transcription of the nrdAB operon, as compared with the corresponding wild type parent (maximal induction of 10- and 9-fold for mRNA of nrdA and nrdB genes, respectively). Likewise, a dramatic increase of 36-fold in grxA mRNA was observed in bacteria simultaneously deficient in thioredoxin and GSH (the physiological reductant of all glutaredoxins). The increased expression of the grxA gene in trxA gshA double mutant bacteria was mimicked in trxA single mutant cells by depletion of GSH with diethylmaleate (DEM). This induction of grxA transcription was rapid since maximal increase was detected upon 10 min of DEM exposure. Like grxA expression, the basal level of fpg mRNA, encoding formamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylase, was increased (about 4-fold) in a trxA gshA double mutant strain; this expression was also induced upon exposure to DEM (11-fold maximal induction). These results suggest that transcription of grxA might share common redox regulatory mechanism(s) with that of the fpg gene, involved in the repair of 8-oxoguanine in DNA.\n",

The decolorization ratio, CODCr removal ratio, BOD5/CODCr value, and volatile fatty acids (VFAs) production were almost better in stage 1 than that in stage 2. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) confirmed the biodegradation of Reactive Black 5 (RB5) and Remazol Brilliant Blue R (RBBR) in hydrolysis acidification process. Polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) analyses revealed that significant difference of microbial community structures existed in stage 1 and 2. The dominant species in stage 1 was related to Bacteroidetes group, while the dominant species in stage 2 was related to Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes groups. From the results, it could be speculated that different dyes’ structures might have significant influence on the existence and function of different bacterial species, which might supply information for bacteria screening and acclimation in the treatment of actual dyeing wastewater.\n",

      " \n",
      "A reliable selective and sensitive antibody-coated competitive real-time immuno-PCR (RT-IPCR) assay for the determination of phenanthrene (PH) was developed. Phenanthrene butanoic acid (γ-oxo-PHA) was synthesized as the hapten of PH. An active ester method was used to couple the PHA to bovine serum albumin to form an artificial immune antigen. Male New Zealand white rabbits were immunized with immune antigen to obtain polyclonal antibodies, with which a novel RT-IPCR assay for determination of PH was developed. Under the optimized assay conditions, PH can be determined in the concentration range from 10 fg/mL to 100 pg/mL with a detection limit of 5 fg/mL. The cross-reactivities of the anti-PH antibody to seven structurally related compounds were below 12.5%. Some environmental water samples were analyzed with satisfactory results, which showed good accuracy and suitability to analyze PH in environmental water. Compared with high-performance liquid chromatography, the recovery was lower or higher with agitation but would still be acceptable for use in an on-site field test to provide rapid, semiquantitative, and reliable test results for making environmental decisions.\n",

      "Archaea have been detected recently as a major and often dominant component of the microbial communities performing ammonia oxidation in terrestrial and marine environments. In a molecular survey of archaeal ammonia monooxygenase (AMO) genes in terrestrial hot springs of Iceland and Kamchatka, the amoA gene encoding the alpha-subunit of AMO was detected in a total of 14 hot springs out of the 22 investigated. Most of these amoA-positive hot springs had temperatures between 82 and 97 degrees C and pH range between 2.5 and 7. In phylogenetic analyses, these amoA genes formed three independent lineages within the known sequence clusters of marine or soil origin. Furthermore, in situ gross nitrification rates in Icelandic hot springs were estimated by the pool dilution technique directly on site. At temperatures above 80 degrees C, between 56 and 159 mumol NO(3)(-) L(-1) mud per day was produced. Furthermore, addition of ammonium to the hot spring samples before incubation yielded a more than twofold higher potential nitrification rate, indicating that the process was limited by ammonia supply. Our data provide evidence for an active role of archaea in nitrification of hot springs in a wide range of pH values and at a high temperature.\n",

      " \n",
      "Presented here is a description of an ultrahigh-energy hydrogen thyratron/SCR bidirectional waveform research defibrillator having a sinusoidal voltage source for inducing fibrillation and three pulse generators for generating defibrillatory waveforms. The first pulse generator uses an 18 kJ capacitor bank at 0·8, 1·6 or 2·4 kV discharged through the chest by two series-connected silicon-controlled rectifiers (SCRs). Two other series-connected SCRs in parallel with the bank terminate the discharge. The second pulse generator uses an 18 kJ bank at 5, 10 or 15 kV. Ceramic-enveloped hydrogen thyratrons in series with the chest initiate the discharge, and in parallel with the bank terminate the discharge. The third pulse generator supplies a reverse-current pulse when used with either the first or second pulse generators to produce bidirectional waveforms. An 18 kJ bank at 2·5, 5 or 10 kV is discharged by an SCR chain in series with the chest. The discharge is terminated by an SCR chain in parallel with the bank. Symmetrical bidirectional rectangular, truncated exponential, and untruncated exponential waveforms are generated by the first and third pulse generators with their respective banks at 2·4 and 2·5 kV, the second and third pulse generators with their banks at 5 kV, or the second and third pulse generators with their banks at 10 kV. The full energy-storage capabilities of the capacitor banks can be used in the first two arrangements; usable energy storage in the third arrangement is limited to about 10 kJ per bank.\n",

      " \n",
      "Laboratory experiments have been conducted to elucidate the degradation of alpha-methylnaphthalene in lake sediments using an advanced oxidation process (AOP) employing peroxy-acids as oxidizing agents. Abiotic degradation of alpha-methylnaphthalene was observed in sediment samples exposed to a 1:1:1 v/v/v mixture of water/organic acid/hydrogen peroxide solution. Sediment samples were collected from Lake Macatawa (Holland, MI) and ranged in total organic carbon content from 2.1% (sandy sediment sample III) to 12.8% (silty-clay sediment sample I) and surface area, which ranged from 3.2m(2)/g (sandy sediment sample III) to 22.0m(2)/g (silty-clay sediment sample I). Analytical measurements performed by gas chromatography revealed varied rates of degradation, depending on the type of acid and the characteristics of the sediment sample. Within 24h, alpha-methylnaphthalene was reduced to 70% and 100% of its original concentration when propionic acid and acetic acid were used as the organic acids, respectively. The formation of products was explored using a gas chromatograph equipped with a mass spectrometer and indicated mainly the formation of lower molecular weight compounds, such as alkyl chains. This AOP method of PAH degradation in sediment/liquid slurry was fast acting and products were most likely biodegradable.\n",

      "10.1111/pce.12701\n",
      " \n",
      "In nature, H2 production in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii serves as a safety valve during the induction of photosynthesis in anoxia, and it prevents the over-reduction of the photosynthetic electron transport chain. Sulphur deprivation of C. reinhardtii also triggers a complex metabolic response resulting in the induction of various stress-related genes, down-regulation of photosynthesis, the establishment of anaerobiosis and expression of active hydrogenase. Photosystem II (PSII) plays dual role in H2 production because it supplies electrons but the evolved O2 inhibits the hydrogenase. Here, we show that upon sulphur deprivation, the ascorbate content in C. reinhardtii increases about 50-fold, reaching the mM range; at this concentration, ascorbate inactivates the Mn-cluster of PSII, and afterwards, it can donate electrons to tyrozin Z(+) at a slow rate. This stage is followed by donor-side-induced photoinhibition, leading to the loss of charge separation activity in PSII and reaction centre degradation. The time point at which maximum ascorbate concentration is reached in the cell is critical for the establishment of anaerobiosis and initiation of H2 production. We also show that ascorbate influenced H2 evolution via altering the photosynthetic electron transport rather than hydrogenase activity and starch degradation.\n",

      " \n",
      "A new and eco-friendly mussel-inspired surface modification pathway for bamboo fiber (BF) is presented in this study. The self-assembly polydopamine (PDA) coating can firmly adhere on BF surface, which also serves as a bridge to graft octadecylamine (ODA) for hydrophobic surface preparation. The as-formed PDA/ODA hybrid layer could supply abundant hydrophobic long-chain alkyls groups and generated a marked increase in BF surface roughness and a marked decrease in surface free energy. These changes provided advantages to improve fiber⁻matrix interfacial adhesion and wettability. Consequently, high performance was achieved by incorporating the hybrid modified BF into the polybutylene succinate (PBS) matrix. The resultant composite exhibited excellent mechanical properties, particularly tensile strength, which markedly increased by 77.2%. Meanwhile, considerable high water resistance with an absorption rate as low as 5.63% was also achieved. The gratifying macro-performance was primarily attributed to the excellent interfacial adhesion attained by hydrogen bonding and physical intertwining between the PDA/ODA coating on the BF and the PBS matrix, which was further determined by fracture morphology observations and dynamic mechanical analysis. Owing to the superior adhesive capacity of PDA, this mussel-inspired surface modification method may result in wide-ranging applications in polymer composites and be adapted to all natural fibers.\n",

      "A dual-electrode membrane electrode assembly (MEA) for proton exchange membrane fuel cells with enhanced polarization under zero relative humidity (RH) is fabricated by introducing a phase-separated morphology in an agglomerated catalyst layer of Pt/C (platinum on carbon black) and Nafion. In the catalyst layer, a sufficient level of phase separation is achieved by dispersing the Pt catalyst and the Nafion dispersion in a mixed-solvent system (propane-1,2,3-triol/1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone).The high polymer chain mobility results in improved water uptake and regular pore-size distribution with small pore diameters. The electrochemical performance of the dual-film electrode assembly with different levels of phase separation is compared to conventional electrode assemblies. As a result, good performance at 0 % RH is obtained because self-humidification is dramatically improved by attaching this dense and phase-separated catalytic overlayer onto the conventional catalyst layer. A MEA prepared using the thin-film, dual-layered electrode exhibits 39-fold increased RH stability and 28-fold improved start-up recovery time during the on-off operation relative to the conventional device. We demonstrate the successful operation of the dual-layered electrode comprised of discriminatively phase-separated agglomerates with an ultrahigh zero RH fuel-cell performance reaching over 95 % performance of a fully humidified MEA.\n",

      " \n",
      "The methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris is a powerful system for production of recombinant proteins, showing high ability to secrete properly folded proteins. A major plus is the strong AOX1 promoter highly induced by methanol. During growth on methanol, however, oxygen readily becomes limiting. In oxygen-limited cultivations of recombinant Pichia pastoris, the methanol concentration had a strong impact on the production of a single-chain antibody fragment (scFv). High methanol concentrations were required to compensate the lack of oxygen and fully induce recombinant protein production, at the same time reducing gratuitous biomass formation due to a lower biomass yield. Product concentrations of 60, 150, and 350 mg/L were obtained with methanol concentrations of 0.3, 1, and 3% (v/v). Moreover, accumulation of a putative product fragment that cannot be removed during affinity purification was prevented at high methanol concentrations. Cell vitality after 100 h was maintained above 98% and 96% of the culture with 0.3% and 3% methanol, respectively. In cultivations supplemented with oxygen, in contrast, methanol concentration between 0.3% and 3% did not influence the product yield of 300-400 mg/L. Thus, efficient recombinant protein production under oxygen-limitation seems to require high methanol concentrations, enabling product concentration as high as otherwise obtained only with expensive supply of pure oxygen.\n",

      " \n",
      "The development of the stationary-phase, low-pH-inducible acid tolerance response (ATR) in the Salmonella contaminant of beef during the processing arises food safety concerns, because it may evoke bacterial coping mechanisms against bactericidal insults and alter gene expression that contribute to pathogen virulence. However, information on the development of the ATR and the stability (defined as the capacity to maintain the acquired acid tolerance after induction) in the Salmonella during the production and distribution of beef is limited. After adaptation overnight, ATRs in the 79 strains of Salmonella isolated from beef processing plants were investigated by comparing the log reduction in the 2-h acid challenge trials at pH 3.0. Six representative strains were selected to further estimate the effect of three factors in the incubation period on the development of the ATR, including adapted pH values (5.0, 5.4, 6.0, and 7.0), temperatures (10 °C and 37 °C), and the adaptation media (meat extract and brain heart infusion media). The stability of acid tolerance during the long-time chilled storage (4 °C for 13 days) was also observed on two strains of serotypes S. Derby and S. Meleagridis. All the strains isolated from beef processing plants exhibited an enhanced acid tolerance indicating the widespread existence of ATR. The results also revealed that strain variability was present in the development of ATR. Significant tolerance to lethal acidic environments (pH 3.0) was found when the Salmonella strains had been acid-adapted in meat extract at pH 5.0, pH 5.4, or pH 6.0, which indicated the possible induction of ATR during beef production. After the acid adaptations, the population reduction after the acid challenge (BHI, pH = 3) in the strains was significantly lower than the non-induced at the 1d, 7 day and 13 day's storage in meat extract media at 4 °C, which revealed the persistence of ATR during beef distribution. Compared to 37 °C, adaptation in lower temperature (10 °C) significantly reduced the ATR and no ATR was developed when adapted in 4 °C. This emphasizes the importance of keeping a low temperature of beef throughout the supply chains of beef industry.\n",

      "10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.142259\n",
      " \n",
      "Currently, there is no effective vaccine for tackling the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 with the occurrence of repeat waves of infection frequently stretching hospital resources beyond capacity. Disease countermeasures rely upon preventing person-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV2 so as to protect front-line healthcare workers (HCWs). COVID-19 brings enormous challenges in terms of sustaining the supply chain for single-use-plastic personal and protective equipment (PPE). Post-COVID-19, the changes in medical practice will drive high demand for PPE. Important countermeasures for preventing COVID-19 transmission include mitigating potential high risk aerosol transmission in healthcare setting using medical PPE (such as filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs)) and the appropriate use of face coverings by the general public that carries a lower transmission risk. PPE reuse is a potential short term solution during COVID-19 pandemic where there is increased evidence for effective deployment of reprocessing methods such as vaporized hydrogen peroxide (30 to 35% VH2O2) used alone or combined with ozone, ultraviolet light at 254 nm (2000 mJ/cm2) and moist heat (60 °C at high humidity for 60 min). Barriers to PPE reuse include potentially trust and acceptance by HCWs. Efficacy of face coverings are influenced by the appropriate wearing to cover the nose and mouth, type of material used, number of layers, duration of wearing, and potentially superior use of ties over ear loops. Insertion of a nose clip into cloth coverings may help with maintaining fit. Use of 60 °C for 60 min (such as, use of domestic washing machine and spin dryer) has been advocated for face covering decontamination. Risk of virus infiltration in improvised face coverings is potentially increased by duration of wearing due to humidity, liquid diffusion and virus retention. Future sustained use of PPE will be influenced by the availability of recyclable PPE and by innovative biomedical waste management.\n",

In rats fed a high fat diet the concentration ratio of malate and ATP/ADP does not reflect the changes in ΔpHm and ΔΨm, which represent the respective driving force for their transport.The findings are in line with an increase in substrate supply to the respiratory chain which is, however, accompanied by a higher energy turnover in livers from HFD rats. By this way the liver could contribute to the lack of weight gain from the high caloric intake in HFD rats.\n",

      "Aloe vera (ALV) with its unique nutritional profile is being used for food, health, and nutraceutical industries globally. Due to its organic nature, ALV gel coating has created lot of interest for exploring its potential in extending the shelf and storage life of fresh produce. ALV gel coating plays imperative role in delaying fruit ripening by lowering ethylene biosynthesis, respiration rate, and internal metabolic activities associated with fruit softening, color development, enzymatic browning, and decay. ALV gel coating reduces the microbial spoilage due to its antifungal properties and maintains visual appearance, firmness, sugar: acid ratio, total antioxidants, and phenolic contents with conserved eating quality. ALV coated fruits and vegetables showed reduced weight loss, superoxide ion ( O 2 - ∙   ), hydrogen peroxide (H2 O2 ), ion leakage, and soluble solids content and exhibited higher acidity, anthocyanins, ascorbic acid, catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) activities. It also delayed the enzymatic browning by inducing peroxidase (POD) activity during storage. Recent local studies also revealed that ALV gel coating markedly conserved higher consuming quality and extended storage period (>1.34-fold) of different fruits and vegetables. Overall, Aloe vera gel coating alone or in combination with other organic compounds has shown great potential as a food-safe and eco-friendly coating for maintaining the quality of fruits and vegetables over extended period and reducing postharvest losses in the supply chain. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: ALV gel is a plant-based natural coating of eco-friendly nature. The present review summarizes the updated information of ALV gel coating application, methods of extraction, combinations with other postharvest coatings, and its impact on quality of various fruits and vegetables. It also provides future insights for the development of commercially applicable ALV gel coating protocols through simulation studies. So, being a natural coating, ALV gel has tremendous potential to be used in fruit and vegetable industries around the globe.\n",

These viruses were found in 80% and 70% of the samples collected respectively and both were present in 57.5%. The DNA sequences analysis showed that 21 estuarine water samples were associated with HAV and 13 with NV. Faecal coliforms were isolated in 48.57% of the samples, while Escherichia coli were found in 34.28%. CONCLUSIONS: DNA sequencing showed that the genotype IB for HAV and GII for NV were predominant in México. No significant relationships were detected between indicators and viruses (P < 0.05).

      "With the method of Polymerase Chain Reaction and homologous genetic recombination in vivo, the key gene encoding bacterial-type phytoene desaturase (Crtl) which controls the carotenoids biosynthesis pathway in the non-photosynthetic and extremely radioresistant bacterium Deinococcus radiodurans was deleted from the genome. The colorless mutant obtained was designated as M61. Survival rates of mutant strain and wild type strain were investigated under different doses of gamma-radiation and hydrogen peroxide. The results showed that the radioresistant activity of M61 reduced rapidly under ionization radiation, and it became more sensitive to the treatment of hydrogen peroxide especially to high concentration of hydrogen peroxide compared to that of wild type R1. Reverse Phase High Performance Liquid Chromatography (RP-HPLC) was used to investigate the carotenoid composition of wild type R1 and mutant M61. HPLC results exhibited that the deficient of crtl gene had important effect on pigment biosynthesis pathway, leading to inhibition of the biosynthesis of lycopene and other carotenoids in D. radiodurans. All the results indicated that crtl gene was a key gene controlling the biosynthesis of red carotenoid including lycopene in D. radiodurans. The roles of carotenoids in protecting the bacterial cell from damage by ionization radiation and hydrogen peroxide suggest that the carotenoids contribute to the defense system in D. radiodurans. This study is important for elucidating the radioresistant and antioxidant mechanism in which carotenoids are involved, and it will supply some ideas to the further investigation on the biosynthesis pathway and functions of carotenoids in D. radiodurans.\n",

      " \n",
      "Cellulase Cel48F from Clostridium cellulolyticum was described as a processive endo-cellulase. The active site is composed of a 25 A long tunnel which is followed by an open cleft. During the processive action, the cellulose substrate has to slide through the tunnel to continuously supply the leaving group site with sugar residues after the catalytic cleavage. To study this processive action in the tunnel, the native catalytic module of Cel48F and the inactive mutant E55Q, have been cocrystallized with cellobiitol, two thio-oligosaccharide inhibitors (PIPS-IG3 and IG4) and the cello-oligosaccharides cellobiose, -tetraose and -hexaose. Seven sub-sites in the tunnel section of the active center could be identified and three of the four previously reported sub-sites in the open cleft section were reconfirmed. The sub-sites observed for the thio-oligosaccharide inhibitors and oligosaccharides, respectively, were located at two different positions in the tunnel corresponding to a shift in the chain direction of about a half sugar subunit. These two positions have different patterns of stacking interactions with aromatic residues present in the tunnel. Multiple patterns are not observed in nonprocessive endo-cellulases, where only one sugar position is favored by aromatic stacking. It is therefore proposed that the aromatic residues serve as lubricating agents to reduce the sliding barrier in the processive action.\n",

      " \n",
      "Understanding the factors that affect biological recovery from environmental stressors such as acidification is an important challenge in ecology. Here we report on zooplankton community recovery following the experimental acidification of Little Rock Lake, Wisconsin, USA. One decade following cessation of acid additions to the northern basin of Little Rock Lake (LRL), recovery of the zooplankton community was complete. Approximately 40% of zooplankton species in the lake exhibited a recovery lag in which biological recovery to reference basin levels was delayed by 1-6 yr after pH recovered to the level at which the species originally responded. Delays in recovery such as those we observed in LRL may be attributable to \"biological resistance\" wherein establishment of viable populations of key acid-sensitive species following water quality improvements is prevented by other components of the community that thrived during acidification. Indeed, we observed that the recovery of species that thrived during acidification tended to precede recovery of species that declined during acidification. In addition, correspondence analysis indicated that the zooplankton community followed different pathways during acidification and recovery, suggesting that there is substantial hysteresis in zooplankton recovery from acidification. By providing an example of a relatively rapid recovery from short-term acidification, zooplankton community recovery from experimental acidification in LRL generally reinforces the positive outlook for recovery reported for other acidified lakes.\n",

      " \n",
      "The melting behaviour and transport properties of straight chain alkanes mono- and difunctionalized with phosphonic acid groups have been investigated as a function of their length. The increase of melting temperature and decrease of proton conductivity with increasing chain length is suggested to be the consequence of an increasing ordering of the alkane segments which constrains the free aggregation of the phosphonic acid groups. However, the proton mobility is reduced to a greater extent than the proton diffusion coefficient indicating an increasing cooperativity of proton transport with increasing length of the alkane segment. The results clearly indicate that the \"spacer concept\", which had been proven successful in the optimization of the proton conductivity of heterocycle based systems, fails in the case of phosphonic acid functionalized polymers. Instead, a very high concentration of phosphonic acid functional groups forming \"bulky\" hydrogen bonded aggregates is suggested to be essential for obtaining very high proton conductivity. Aggregation is also suggested to reduce condensation reactions generally observed in phosphonic acid containing systems. On the basis of this understanding, the proton conductivities of poly(vinyl phosphonic acid) and poly(meta-phenylene phosphonic acid) are discussed. Though both polymers exhibit a substantial concentration of phosphonic acid groups, aggregation seems to be constrained to such an extent that intrinsic proton conductivity is limited to values below sigma = 10(-3) S cm(-1) at T = 150 degrees C. The results suggest that different immobilization concepts have to be developed in order to minimize the conductivity reduction compared to the very high intrinsic proton conductivity of neat phosphonic acid under quasi dry conditions. In the presence of high water activities, however, (as usually present in PEM fuel cells) the very high ion exchange capacities (IEC) possible for phosphonic acid functionalized ionomers (IEC >10 meq g(-1)) may allow for high proton conductivities in the intermediate temperature range (T approximately 120 -160 degrees C).\n",

      "By using different pH indicators it is possible to demonstrate, in the presence or absence of phosphorylation, the existence of two compartments in chloroplasts, one of which becomes more acidic and the other more basic during electron flow. The observed magnitude of the pH differential between these two compartments is over 1.5 pH units. Cations, such as NH4 +, N-methylphenazonium methosulfate, and protonated neutral red, which compete with H+ ions for entry into chloroplasts, inhibit the development of pH gradients within chloroplasts. Diffusible anions, such as acetate and orthophosphate, also block formation of these internal pH gradients. All of the above inhibitors of formation of internal pH gradients also inhibit phosphorylation, in a parallel manner. Sonic treatment of chloroplasts causes progressive and parallel inhibition of phosphorylation and formation of internal pH gradients. These data support the concept that chloroplasts contain a proton-translocating oxidation-reduction chain and that the resultant efflux of H+ ions through chloroplast membranes supplies the energy for phosphorylation.\n",

      "Proton conducting polymer composite membranes are of technological interest in many energy devices such as fuel cells and redox flow batteries. In particular, polymer composite membranes, such as SiO(2) incorporated Nafion membranes, are recently reported as highly promising for the use in redox flow batteries. However, there is conflicting reports regarding the performance of this type of Nafion-SiO(2) composite membrane in the redox flow cell. This paper presents results of the analysis of the Nafion-SiO(2) composite membrane used in a vanadium redox flow battery by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Fourier Transform Infra Red (FTIR) spectroscopy, and ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy. The XPS study reveals the chemical identity and environment of vanadium cations accumulated at the surface. On the other hand, the (19)F and (29)Si NMR measurement explores the nature of the interaction between the silica particles, Nafion side chains and diffused vanadium cations. The (29)Si NMR shows that the silica particles interact via hydrogen bonds with the sulfonic groups of Nafion and the diffused vanadium cations. Based on these spectroscopic studies, the chemical environment of the silica particles inside the Nafion membrane and their interaction with diffusing vanadium cations during flow cell operations are discussed. This study discusses the origin of performance degradation of the Nafion-SiO(2) composite membrane materials in vanadium redox flow batteries.\n",

      "The purpose of this study was an evaluation of the effect levels of various toxic agents compared with acute doses of ionizing radiation for the experimental model ecosystem, i.e., microcosm mimicking aquatic microbial communities. For this purpose, the authors used the microcosm consisting of populations of the flagellate alga Euglena gracilis as a producer, the ciliate protozoan Tetrahymena thermophila as a consumer and the bacterium Escherichia coli as a decomposer. Effects of aluminum and copper on the microcosm were investigated in this study, while effects of gamma-rays, ultraviolet radiation, acidification, manganese, nickel and gadolinium were reported in previous studies. The microcosm could detect not only the direct effects of these agents but also the community-level effects due to the interspecies interactions or the interactions between organisms and toxic agents. The authors evaluated doses or concentrations of each toxic agent which had the following effects on the microcosm: (1) no effects; (2) recognizable effects, i.e., decrease or increase in the cell densities of at least one species; (3) severe effects, i.e., extinction of one or two species; and (4) destructive effects, i.e., extinction of all species. The resulting effects data will contribute to an ecological risk assessment of the toxic agents compared with acute doses of ionizing radiation.\n",

      " \n",
      "BackgroundMicroalgae are a promising feedstock for biofuel and bioenergy production due to their high photosynthetic efficiencies, high growth rates and no need for external organic carbon supply. In this study, utilization of Chlorella vulgaris (a fresh water microalga) and Dunaliella tertiolecta (a marine microalga) biomass was tested as a feedstock for anaerobic H2 and CH4 production.ResultsAnaerobic serum bottle assays were conducted at 37°C with enrichment cultures derived from municipal anaerobic digester sludge. Low levels of H2 were produced by anaerobic enrichment cultures, but H2 was subsequently consumed even in the presence of 2-bromoethanesulfonic acid, an inhibitor of methanogens. Without inoculation, algal biomass still produced H2 due to the activities of satellite bacteria associated with algal cultures. CH4 was produced from both types of biomass with anaerobic enrichments. Polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis profiling indicated the presence of H2-producing and H2-consuming bacteria in the anaerobic enrichment cultures and the presence of H2-producing bacteria among the satellite bacteria in both sources of algal biomass.ConclusionsH2 production by the satellite bacteria was comparable from D. tertiolecta (12.6 ml H2/g volatile solids (VS)) and from C. vulgaris (10.8 ml H2/g VS), whereas CH4 production was significantly higher from C. vulgaris (286 ml/g VS) than from D. tertiolecta (24 ml/g VS). The high salinity of the D. tertiolecta slurry, prohibitive to methanogens, was the probable reason for lower CH4 production.\n",

      "Background. Fresh vegetables such as tomato should have low microbial population for safe consumption and long storage life. The aerobic bacterial count (ABC) and coliform bacterial count (CBC), yeast, and mold population are the most widely used microbial indicators in fresh vegetables which should be lower than 4 log CFU g-1 for safe consumption. The stages of the supply chain, postharvest handling methods, and crop varieties had significant effects on microbial population. ABC, CBC, yeast, and mold population were significantly highest (P < 0.05) at retail market (5.59, 4.38, 2.60, and 3.14 log CFU g-1, resp.), followed by wholesale market (4.72, 4.71, 2.43, and 2.44 log CFU g-1, resp.), and were least at farm gate (3.89, 3.63, 2.38, and 2.03 log CFU g-1, resp.). Improved postharvest practices (washing in clean water and grading and packaging in clean plastic crate) helped to reduce ABC, CBC, and mold population by 2.51, 32.70, and 29.86 percentage as compared to the conventional method (no washing and no grading and packaging in mud plastered bamboo baskets). Among varieties, Pusa ruby had the lowest microbial load of 2.58, 4.53, 0.96, and 1.77 log CFU g-1 for ABC, CBC, yeast, and mold count, respectively. Significantly negative correlation (P < 0.05) was observed between fruit pH & ABC and pH & mold count. Although the microbial quality of fresh tomato is safe in the local market of western Terai of Nepal both in conventional and in improved practices however still it is essential to follow improved postharvest handling practices in production and marketing of newly introduced tomato cultivars (high-pH cultivars) for ensuring the safe availability of fresh tomato in the market.\n",

      " \n",
      "The most important stimulus for the enhanced synthesis of erythropoietin (Epo) is a lowered O2 tension in the tissue. However, the mechanism by which an impaired O2 supply is transduced into appropriate Epo production is still not fully understood. Recently, studies in human hepatoma cells (line HepG2) indicate that reactive O2 species are involved in the signal transduction from the cellular O2 sensor to the Epo gene. To clarify the role of reactive O2 species in the regulation of Epo synthesis in the kidney, the principal Epo-producing organ in vivo, we investigated the influence of potent pro- and antioxidants on Epo production in isolated perfused rat kidneys. Under normoxic conditions, the iron chelator desferrioxamine and the antioxidant vitamin A increased renal Epo production, mimicking hypoxic induction. In contrast, supplementation of the perfusion medium of hypoxically perfused kidneys with the prooxidant compounds H2O2 or pyrogallol caused a significant reduction of Epo synthesis. The inhibition of Epo formation by reactive O2 species could be completely antagonized by desferrioxamine and the hydroxyl radical-(OH*)-scavenger tetramethylthiourea. Vitamin A also antagonized the H2O2-dependent inhibition of hypoxically induced Epo synthesis. Interestingly, the addition of the antioxidant vitamin A to hypoxically perfused kidneys also induced Epo production significantly. Our data strongly support the idea that reactive O2 species, especially H2O2, are part of the signaling chain of the cellular O2-sensing mechanism regulating the renal synthesis of Epo.\n",

      " \n",
      "Urease gene expression in Streptococcus salivarius 57.I, a strain of one of the major alkali producers in the mouth, is induced by acidic pH and excess amounts of carbohydrate. Expression is controlled primarily at the transcriptional level from a promoter, pureI. Recent sequencing analysis revealed a CodY box located 2 bases 5' to the -35 element of pureI. Using continuous chemostat culture, transcription from pureI was shown to be repressed by CodY, and at pH 7 the repression was more pronounced than that in cells grown at pH 5.5 under both 20 and 100 mM glucose. The direct binding of CodY to pureI was demonstrated by electrophoretic mobility shift assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). The result of ChIP-qPCR also confirmed that the regulation of CodY is indeed modulated by pH and the binding of CodY at neutral pH is further enhanced by a limited supply of glucose (20 mM). In the absence of CodY, the C-terminal domain of the RNA polymerase (RNAP) α subunit interacted with the AT tracks within the CodY box, indicating that CodY and RNAP compete for the same binding region. Such regulation could ensure optimal urease expression when the enzyme is most required, i.e., at an acidic growth pH with an excess amount of carbon nutrients.\n",

      " \n",
      "Novel environmental air and water mycobacteria sampling and analytical methods are needed to circumvent difficulties associated with the use of culture-based methodologies. To implement this objective, a commercial, clinical, genus DNA amplification method utilizing the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was interfaced with novel air sampling strategies in the laboratory. Two types of air samplers, a three-piece plastic, disposable filter cassette and an eight-stage micro-orifice uniform deposit impactor (MOUDI), were used in these studies. In both samplers, 37-mm polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) filters were used. Use of the MOUDI sampler permitted the capture of airborne mycobacteria in discrete size ranges, an important parameter for relating the airborne mycobacteria cells to potential respirable particles (aerodynamic diameter <10 microm) capable of causing health effects. Analysis of the samples was rapid, requiring only 1-1.5 days, as no microbial culturing or DNA purification was required. This approach was then used to detect suspected mycobacteria contamination associated with pools at a large public facility. PCR was also used to analyze various water samples from these pools. Again, no culturing or sample purification was required. Water samples taken from all ultraviolet light/hydrogen peroxide-treated whirlpools tested positive for the presence of mycobacteria. No mycobacteria were detected in the chlorine-treated pools and the water main supply facility. All air samples collected in the proximity of the indoor whirlpools and the associated changing rooms were strongly positive for airborne mycobacteria. The airborne mycobacteria particles were predominantly collected on MOUDI stages 1-6 representing an aerodynamic size range of 0.5 to 9.9 microm. In conclusion, using this approach permits the rapid detection of mycobacteria contamination as well as the routine monitoring of suspected pools. The approach circumvents problems associated with culture-based methods such as fungal overgrowth on agar plates, and the presence of nonculturable or difficult to culture mycobacteria strains.\n",

      "10.1242/jeb.202.24.3541\n",
      " \n",
      "Redox chemistry, involving the transfer of electrons and hydrogen atoms, is central to energy conversion in respiration, and the control of gene expression by redox state commonly occurs in bacteria, allowing rapid responses to environmental changes, for instance, in the food supply. Colonial metazoans often encrust surfaces over which the food supply varies in time or space; hence, in these organisms, redox control of the development of feeding structures and gastrovascular connections could be similarly adaptive, allowing colonies to adjust the timing and spacing of structures in response to a variable food supply. To investigate the possibility of redox control of colony development, the redox states of hydractiniid hydroid colonies were manipulated experimentally. As in many colonial animals, hydractiniid hydroids display a range of morphological variation from sheet-like forms (i.e. closely spaced polyps with high rates of stolon branching) to runner-like forms (i. e. widely spaced polyps with low rates of stolon branching). In the runner-like Podocoryna carnea, azide, a blocker of the electron transport chain, and dinitrophenol, an uncoupler of oxidative phosphorylation, diminished the largely polyp-driven gastrovascular flow to a similar extent. Measures of the redox state of the polyp epitheliomuscular cells using the fluorescence of NAD(P)H suggest that azide shifts the redox state in the direction of reduction, while dinitrophenol shifts the redox state in the direction of oxidation. Colony development corresponds to redox state in that azide-treated colonies were more runner-like, while dinitrophenol-treated colonies were more sheet-like. Nevertheless, the functional role of polyps in feeding and generating gastrovascular flow probably contributed to a trade-off between polyp number and size such that azide-treated colonies had few large polyps, while dinitrophenol-treated colonies had many small polyps. Regardless of the treatment, P. carnea colonies developed to maturity and produced swimming medusae in the normal fashion. In the sheet-like Hydractinia symbiolongicarpus, treatment with azide resulted in complete suppression of the development of both the stolonal mat and the blastostyles, the reproductive polyps. Azide-treated H. symbiolongicarpus colonies therefore developed in a juvenilized, runner-like manner and much resembled colonies of P. carnea. Following cessation of azide treatment in H. symbiolongicarpus, normal colony development ensued, and both a stolonal mat and blastostyles formed. In both hydroid species, relative oxidization favors sheet-like growth, while relative reduction favors runner-like growth. Since feeding triggers strong contractions of polyp epitheliomuscular cells and results in relative oxidation, this experimental evidence supports the hypothesis of adaptive redox control of colony development and evolution.\n",

      "Auricularia auricula spent substrate (AASS) modified by didodecyldimethylammonium bromide(DDAB) was used as adsorbent to remove Cr(VI) from aqueous solution. Based on a single-factor experiment and response surface methodology, the optimal conditions were adsorbent dosage of 1.5 g/L, pH value of 4.0, initial Cr(VI) concentration of 19 mg/L, temperature of 25 °C, biosorption time of 120 min, rotational speed of 150 r/min, respectively, under which biosorption capacity could reach 12.16 mg/g compared with unmodified AASS (6.058 mg/g). DDAB modification could enlarge the specific surface area and porous diameter of the adsorbents, and supply hydrophilic and hydrophobic groups capable of adsorbing at the interfaces. In addition, DDAB increased ionic exchange and complex formation demonstrated by variations of elemental contents, shifts of carboxyl, amine groups, hydroxyl, alkyl chains, and phosphate groups as well as the crystal structure of the Cr-O compounds. Variations of peaks and energy in XPS analysis also testified the reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III).The biosorption behavior of modified AASS was in line with Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm equation. The final regeneration efficiency was 62.33% after three biosorption-desorption cycles. Apparently, DDBA is a eximious modifier and DDBA-modified AASS was very efficient for Cr(VI) removal.−\n",

      "The specificity of regulation by attenuation of the ilvGMEDA operon of Escherichia coli was examined by making alterations in the peptide-coding portion of the leader region. The effects of the alterations on attenuation control were monitored by operon fusions with the lacZ or cat gene. Substitution of the tandem leucine codons with arginine codons did not result in arginine control of attenuation even though the altered leader transcripts contained three consecutive arginine codons. Substitution of the single leucine codon with a proline codon at position 10 of the putative peptide, which had been shown to be important in the regulation of the Serratia marcescens ilv operon, did not result in control of attenuation by proline. Since the formation of neither proline nor arginine biosynthetic enzymes is regulated by attenuation control, the effect of tandem phenylalanine codons in place of the tandem leucine codons was examined and found not to result in control by phenylalanine supply. The latter failure may have been due to a configuration in the secondary structure of the protector stem of the leader transcript different from that of the wild-type transcript. The results of the study favored the idea that the lead ribosome does not initiate translation of the leader transcript until after the RNA polymerase has reached the pause site (117 bases into the leader region).\n",

These prenyltransferase activities were localized primarily in the soluble enzyme fraction, and separation of this preparation on Sephadex G-150 revealed the presence of a partially resolved, labile geranyl pyrophosphate synthase activity. The product of the condensation reaction between [1-14C]dimethylallyl pyrophosphate and [1-3H]isopentenyl pyrophosphate was verified as [14C,1-3H]geranyl pyrophosphate by TLC isolation, enzymatic hydrolysis to geraniol, degradative studies, and the preparation of the crystalline diphenylurethane. The cis-isomer, neryl pyrophosphate, was not a product of the enzymatic reaction. By employing a selective tissue extraction procedure, the geranyl pyrophosphate synthase activity was localized in the leaf epidermal glands, the site of monoterpene biosynthesis, suggesting that the role of this enzyme is to supply the C10 precursor for the production of monoterpenes. Glandular extracts enriched in geranyl pyrophosphate synthase were partially purified by a combination of hydrophobic interaction chromatography on phenyl-Sepharose and gel permeation chromatography on Sephadex G-150. Substrate and product specificity studies confirmed the selective synthesis of geranyl pyrophosphate by this enzyme, which was also characterized with respect to molecular weight, pH optimum, cation requirement, inhibitors, and kinetic parameters, and shown to resemble other prenyltransferases.\n",

      "White matter degeneration is a pathological hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's. Age remains the greatest risk factor for Alzheimer's and the prevalence of age-related late onset Alzheimer's is greatest in females. We investigated mechanisms underlying white matter degeneration in an animal model consistent with the sex at greatest Alzheimer's risk. Results of these analyses demonstrated decline in mitochondrial respiration, increased mitochondrial hydrogen peroxide production and cytosolic-phospholipase-A2 sphingomyelinase pathway activation during female brain aging. Electron microscopic and lipidomic analyses confirmed myelin degeneration. An increase in fatty acids and mitochondrial fatty acid metabolism machinery was coincident with a rise in brain ketone bodies and decline in plasma ketone bodies. This mechanistic pathway and its chronologically phased activation, links mitochondrial dysfunction early in aging with later age development of white matter degeneration. The catabolism of myelin lipids to generate ketone bodies can be viewed as a systems level adaptive response to address brain fuel and energy demand. Elucidation of the initiating factors and the mechanistic pathway leading to white matter catabolism in the aging female brain provides potential therapeutic targets to prevent and treat demyelinating diseases such as Alzheimer's and multiple sclerosis. Targeting stages of disease and associated mechanisms will be critical.\n",

Because some of these chemicals are highly water soluble, one major pathway for human exposure is the consumption of contaminated drinking water. This study measured concentrations of PFASs in 18 raw drinking water sources and 2 treated wastewater effluents and evaluated 15 full-scale treatment systems for the attenuation of PFASs in water treatment utilities throughout the U.S. A liquid-chromatography tandem mass-spectrometry method was used to enable measurement of a suite of 23 PFASs, including perfluorocarboxylic acids (PFCAs) and perfluorosulfonic acids (PFSAs). Despite the differences in reporting levels, the PFASs that were detected in >70% of the source water samples (n = 39) included PFSAs, perfluorobutane sulfonic acid (74%), perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (79%), and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (84%), and PFCAs, perfluoropentanoic acid (74%), perfluorohexanoic acid (79%), perfluoroheptanoic acid (74%), and perfluorooctanoic acid (74%). More importantly, water treatment techniques such as ferric or alum coagulation, granular/micro-/ultra- filtration, aeration, oxidation (i.e., permanganate, ultraviolet/hydrogen peroxide), and disinfection (i.e., ozonation, chlorine dioxide, chlorination, and chloramination) were mostly ineffective in removing PFASs. However, anion exchange and granular activated carbon treatment preferably removed longer-chain PFASs and the PFSAs compared to the PFCAs, and reverse osmosis demonstrated significant removal for all the PFASs, including the smallest PFAS, perfluorobutanoic acid.\n",

      "Lignocellulosic biomass is a domestically grown, sustainable, and potentially carbon-neutral feedstock for the production of liquid fuels and other value added chemicals. This underutilized renewable feedstock has the potential to alleviate some of the current socio-economic dependence on foreign petroleum supplies while stimulating rural economies. Unfortunately, the potential of biomass has largely been underdeveloped due to the recalcitrant nature of lignocellulosic materials. Task-specific ionic liquids (ILs) have shown considerable promise as an alternative non-aqueous solvent for solvation and deconstruction of lignocellulose in the presence of metal chloride catalyst or enzymes. Recently it has been hypothesized that adding oxygen atoms to the tail of an imidazolium cation would alleviate some of the negative characteristics of the ILs by increasing mass transport properties, and decreasing IL deactivation of enzymes, while at the same time retaining favorable solvation characteristics for lignocellulose. Reported here are fully atomistic molecular dynamic simulations of 1-methyltriethoxy-3-ethylimidazolium acetate ([Me-(OEt)3-Et-IM(+)] [OAc(-)]) that elucidate promising molecular-level details pertaining to the solvation characteristics of model compounds of cellulose, and IL-induced side-chain and ring puckering conformations. It is found that the anion interactions with the saccharide induce alternate ring puckering conformations from those seen in aqueous environments (i.e.(1)C4), while the cation interactions are found to influence the conformation of the ω dihedral. These perturbations in saccharide structures are discussed in the context of their contribution to the disruption of hydrogen bonding in cellulosic architecture and their role in solvation.\n",

Wherein, N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and water with different volume ratio were used as mixed solvents to obtain the solution casting films, P series. In addition, MgCl2·6H2O was comparatively added to prepare PVDF/MgCl2·6H2O hybrid films, P-M series. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) were utilized to study the influence of the water content in the mixed solvents and the hydrated salt on crystallization behavior of PVDF. Further, the morphologic images from scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) and polarized optical microscopy (POM), as well as the pizoelectirc d33 test also supplies the corresponding evidences. As indicated, the water in the mixed solvent shows different effect on main crystal forms of PVDF. At low water content, the solvents may favor the polar phase (β- and γ-phase) mainly by hydrogen bonds interactions between PVDF and water, together with dipolar interactions between PVDF and DMF. At high water content, the nonsolvent water will impose confinement effect on polymer chain diffusion and crystal growth which facilitate the formation of α-phase PVDF. Moreover, magnesium chloride hexahydrate mainly functioned as the nucleation sites for PVDF crystallization. The result of small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) implies the content of water or MgCl2·6H2O has little impact on the structure of the long period.\n",

      "BACKGROUND: Malabsorbed starch is probably the most important substrate for bacterial fermentation in the human large intestine. Fermentability of starch may depend on the composition of the colonic flora and its adaptation to the substrate supply. METHODS: Ten healthy volunteers were fed a controlled diet containing either 7.0 to 8.3 or 50.7 to 59.7 g/d of resistant starch (Hylon VII) for 4 weeks. At the end of each diet period, fecal starch concentrations were measured. Fecal samples were incubated in 48-hour batch cultures containing 10 g/L Hylon VII or digestible Lintner's starch. Bacterial breakdown of starch and short-chain fatty acid concentrations were measured at 0, 3, 6, 12, 24, and 48 hours. RESULTS: Fecal starch concentrations were higher during the Hylon VII period (35.7 +/- 16 vs 8.9 +/- 3.3 mg/g). Starch was fermented rapidly and completely in vitro in all but two subjects. Fermentability of resistant starch was comparable to that of digestible starch. No differences were found between the dietary periods. Fermentation of resistant starch produced higher rates of n-butyrate. Two subjects had substantially higher fecal starch concentrations. In vitro starch breakdown in these subjects was slow and incomplete. CONCLUSIONS: Fermentation of resistant starch by the colonic microflora was rapid and complete in 8 of 10 subjects. No adaptation of the fermentation capacity was observed after 4 weeks of dietary resistant starch supplementation. Fermentation of resistant starch increased the proportion of n-butyrate in vitro. In two subjects, fecal starch concentrations were substantially higher than in the other subjects and in vitro starch fermentation was slow and incomplete.\n",

When CO2 assimilation was the only ATP- and NADPH-consuming reaction, the ΔpH decreased and the chloroplasts showed clear evidence of over-reduction. This suggested that additional electron flow is required in order to maintain the ΔpH and the stromal NADPH/ATP ratio. The additional electron flow may be cyclic electron transport around Photosystem I and linear electron transport towards either oxaloacetate or O2. The contributions of, and the interrelationships between, these three electron transfer pathways were analyzed by following the reactions of chloroplasts in their presence or absence, and by monitoring to what extent they were able to compensate for each other. Inhibition of cyclic electron flow by antimycin A caused strong over-reduction and decreased the ΔpH. Only oxaloacetate, but not O2, was able to restore photosynthesis. In the presence of H2O2, there was a rapid build-up of a high ΔpH, and the reduction of any other electron acceptor was prevented. It is concluded that the different electron acceptors in the stroma are organized in a hierarchical manner; this allows electron flux towards CO2 and nitrite reduction to proceed without any competition for electrons, and any excess electrons to be taken by these additional non-assimilatory pathways. Hence, the ΔpH is maintained at the required level and over-reduction of the electron transport chain and the stromal redox components is avoided.\n",

      "Infection with Trypanosoma congolense in cattle was found to be associated with a profound suppression of the host's immune system. Lymph node cells from infected cattle were unable to secrete interleukin 2 (IL 2) in vitro following mitogenic stimulation and the exogenous supply of IL 2 did not restore T cell proliferative responses. This was associated with an impaired expression of the alpha chain of the IL 2 receptor (IL 2R alpha). Co-culture experiments, where cells from an infected animal were mixed with cells from a major histocompatibility complex-matched normal animal, demonstrated the presence of suppressor cells capable of blocking both IL 2 secretion and IL 2R alpha expression. Removal of macrophages by fluorescence-activated cell sorting abrogated suppression in such co-cultures. Following depletion of macrophages, lymph node cells from an infected animal expressed IL 2R alpha at a normal level, but remained incapable of producing IL 2. Hence, the unresponsiveness was associated with macrophage-like suppressor cells which operated at the level of both IL 2 secretion and IL 2R alpha expression, and to an intrinsic unresponsiveness of the T cells which was restricted to IL 2 secretion. Inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis by addition of indomethacin failed to abrogate suppression of either IL 2 secretion or IL 2R alpha expression. This revealed a major difference between the regulation of suppression in murine model infections where the suppression of IL 2 secretion is due to prostaglandin secretion, and the situation in cattle where prostaglandins would not appear to be involved.\n",

      "Free radicals trigger chain reaction and inflict damage to the cells and its components, which in turn ultimately interrupts their biological activities. To prevent free radical damage, together with an endogenous antioxidant system, an exogenous supply of antioxidant components to the body in the form of functional food or nutritional diet helps undeniably. Research conducted by the Natl. Inst. of Health claimed that Moringa oleifera Lam possess the highest antioxidant content among various natural food sources based on an oxygen radical absorbent capacity assay. In this study, a 90% (ethanol:distilled water--90:10) gradient solvent was identified as one of the best gradient solvents for the effectual extraction of bioactive components from M. oleifera leaves. This finding was confirmed by various antioxidant assays, including radical scavenging activity (that is, 1, 1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl, H(2)O(2), and NO radical scavenging assay) and total antioxidant capacity (that is, ferric reducing antioxidant power and molybdenum assay). High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) fingerprints of the 90% gradient extract visually showed few specific peaks, which on further analysis, using HPLC-DAD-ESI-MS, were identified as flavonoids and their derivatives. Despite commonly reported flavonoids, that is, kaempferol and quercetin, we report here for the 1st time the presence of multiflorin-B and apigenin in M. oleifera leaves. These findings might help researchers to further scrutinize this high activity exhibiting gradient extract and its bio-active candidates for fruitful clinical/translational investigations.\n",

      "When grown in short day conditions and at low light, leaves of Arabidopsis plants with mutations in the genes encoding two plastidial ATP/ADP transporters (so-called null mutants) spontaneously develop necrotic lesions. Under these conditions, the mutants also display light-induced accumulation of H(2)O(2) and constitutive expression of genes for copper/zinc superoxide dismutase 2 and ascorbate peroxidase 1. In the light phase, null mutants accumulate high levels of phototoxic protoporphyrin IX but have only slightly reduced levels of Mg protoporphyrin IX. The physiological changes are associated with reduced magnesium-chelatase activity. Since the expression of genes encoding any of the three subunits of magnesium-chelatase is similar in wild type and null mutants, decreased enzyme activity is probably due to post-translational modification which might be due to limited availability of ATP in plastids during the night. Surprisingly, the formation of necrotic lesions was absent when null mutants were grown either in long days and low light intensity or in short days and high light intensity. We ascribe the lack of lesion phenotype to increased nocturnal ATP supply due to glycolytic degradation of starch which may lead to additional substrate-level phosphorylation in the stroma. Thus, nocturnal import of ATP into chloroplasts represents a crucial, previously unknown process that is required for controlled chlorophyll biosynthesis and for preventing photooxidative damage.\n",

      "The supply of electrons for the hydroxylation reactions associated with cholesterol side-chain cleavage has been studied in intact porcine luteal mitochondria. The work was based on an assay of the NADPH-dependent side-chain-cleavage reaction, the activity of the mitochondrial enzyme complex being expressed as the percentage of [4-14C]cholesterol converted to the products, [4-14C]pregnenolone and [4-14C]progesterone, in 1 h. The reaction could best be supported by intermediates of the tricarboxylic acid cycle, although NADPH, and to a lesser degree NADH, would also support some activity. Investigations of the ADP:O ratios of the substrates which could support cholesterol side-chain cleavage showed that they were lower than the ADP:O ratios found for the same substrates in liver mitochondria from the same animal; respiratory-control ratios were also lower in the ovarian preparation. In the adrenal cortex, another steroid-hydroxylating tissue, similar results obtained by other workers have been interpreted as indicating that the two oxidative chains, the first terminating in cytochrome oxidase and the second in cytochrome P450, are connected by an energy-dependent transhydrogenase. In the ovary this explanation may be true for succinate, but it does not satisfy the results obtained with substrates which reduce NAD(P)+. Although spectrophotometric assays showed that there was some energy-linked transhydrogenase, as well as non-energy-linked transhydrogenase activity in ovarian mitochondria, all the evidence obtained by investigating cholesterol side-chain cleavage supported by NADH and the NAD+-specific 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase indicated that in ovary hydrogen transfer from NADH to the cholesterol-hydroxylation site was not dependent on energy. In contrast, inhibitors of NADH oxidase markedly stimulated NADH-supported side-chain cleavage. Energy was required for the transfer of electrons from succinate to the site of cholesterol side-chain cleavage.\n",

In a parallel study the effects on PMN immune functions were also documented for the first time. The incubation of whole blood with diazepam led to significant changes in PMN free glutamine, aspartate, glutamate, ornithine, arginine, citrulline, taurine and methionine as well as branched chain and neutral amino acid concentrations. Ala-gln caused significant increases in PMN glutamine and alanine and asparagine, aspartate, glutamate, ornithine, arginine, serine and glycine profiles. Regarding PMN immune functions, diazepam significantly decreased superoxide anion (O(2)(-)) and hydrogen peroxide production (H(2)O(2)) and myeloperoxidase activity (MPO) while ala-gln significantly increased PMN immune functions. Ala-gln supplemented to diazepam largely reversed the changes in PMN amino acid profiles and PMN immune functions brought about by diazepam. Overall, diazepam or ala-gln lead to significant changes in PMN free amino acids. Important PMN immune functions also seem to be affected. In regards to the results, there is significant relevance to the pharmacological regimens which enhance the supply of diazepam or ala-gln in whole blood suggesting that considerable changes in PMN \"labile free amino acid pool\" occur. These regimens often follow beneficial nutritional therapy or maleficent pharmacological stress and may be one of the determinants in cell nutrition which influence PMN function. It is partially through its effect on PMN labile free amino acid pool that ala-gln supplemented to diazepam may maintain PMN immune functions in vitro.\n",

      " \n",
      "Formulation of protein biopharmaceuticals as highly concentrated liquids can improve the drug substance storage and supply chain, improve the target product profile, and allow greater flexibility in dosing methods. The Donnan effect can cause a large offset in pH from the target value established with the diafiltration buffer during the concentration and diafiltration of charged proteins with ultrafiltration membranes. For neutral formulations, the pH will typically increase above the diafiltration buffer pH for basic monoclonal antibodies and decline below the diafiltration buffer pH for acidic Fc-fusion proteins. In this study, new equations for the Donnan effect during the diafiltration and concentration of proteins in solutions containing monovalent and divalent ions were derived. The new Donnan models obey mass conservation laws, account for the buffering capacity of proteins, and account for protein-ion binding. Data for the pH offsets of an Fc-fusion protein and a monoclonal antibody were predicted in both monovalent and divalent buffers using these equations. To compensate for the pH offset caused by the Donnan effect, diafiltration buffers with pH and excipient values offset from the ultrafiltrate pool specifications can be used. The Donnan offset observed during the concentration of an acidic Fc-fusion protein was mitigated by operating at low temperature. It is important to account for the Donnan effect during preformulation studies. The excipients levels in an ultrafiltration pool may differ from the levels in a protein solution obtained by adding buffers into concentrated protein solutions due to the Donnan effect.\n",

      "The Earth agglomerates and heats. Convection cells within the planetary interior expedite the cooling process. Volcanoes evolve steam, carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide and pyrophosphate. An acidulous Hadean ocean condenses from the carbon dioxide atmosphere. Dusts and stratospheric sulfurous smogs absorb a proportion of the Sun’s rays. The cooled ocean leaks into the stressed crust and also convects. High temperature acid springs, coupled to magmatic plumes and spreading centers, emit iron, manganese, zinc, cobalt and nickel ions to the ocean. Away from the spreading centers cooler alkaline spring waters emanate from the ocean floor. These bear hydrogen, formate, ammonia, hydrosulfide and minor methane thiol. The thermal potential begins to be dissipated but the chemical potential is dammed. The exhaling alkaline solutions are frustrated in their further attempt to mix thoroughly with their oceanic source by the spontaneous precipitation of biomorphic barriers of colloidal iron compounds and other minerals. It is here we surmise that organic molecules are synthesized, filtered, concentrated and adsorbed, while acetate and methane—separate products of the precursor to the reductive acetyl-coenzyme-A pathway—are exhaled as waste. Reactions in mineral compartments produce acetate, amino acids, and the components of nucleosides. Short peptides, condensed from the simple amino acids, sequester ‘ready-made’ iron sulfide clusters to form protoferredoxins, and also bind phosphates. Nucleotides are assembled from amino acids, simple phosphates carbon dioxide and ribose phosphate upon nanocrystalline mineral surfaces. The side chains of particular amino acids register to fitting nucleotide triplet clefts. Keyed in, the amino acids are polymerized, through acid–base catalysis, to alpha chains. Peptides, the tenuous outer-most filaments of the nanocrysts, continually peel away from bound RNA. The polymers are concentrated at cooler regions of the mineral compartments through thermophoresis. RNA is reproduced through a convective polymerase chain reaction operating between 40 and 100°C. The coded peptides produce true ferredoxins, the ubiquitous proteins with the longest evolutionary pedigree. They take over the role of catalyst and electron transfer agent from the iron sulfides. Other iron–nickel sulfide clusters, sequestered now by cysteine residues as CO-dehydrogenase and acetyl-coenzyme-A synthase, promote further chemosynthesis and support the hatchery—the electrochemical reactor—from which they sprang. Reactions and interactions fall into step as further pathways are negotiated. This hydrothermal circuitry offers a continuous supply of material and chemical energy, as well as electricity and proticity at a potential appropriate for the onset of life in the dark, a rapidly emerging kinetic structure born to persist, evolve and generate entropy while the sun shines.\n",

      "The gradual increase of CO2 concentration in the atmosphere, absorbed by the ocean surface water through air to sea equilibration termed ocean acidification (OA), leads to the decline of pH in seawater. It is not clear so far how the composition of fatty acids, particular the immune-related, in marine crustacean and the subsequent energy supply in marine ecosystem are affected by OA. The brine shrimp Artemia sinica is an open and common feed that provide essential fatty acids for mariculture. In this study, the fatty acids profiles of brine shrimp cultured under different lower pH levels of CO2 driven seawater were investigated. The results showed a significant reduction of the proportion of total saturated fatty acids under the pH7.6 within one week. Meanwhile, the percentage of total monounsaturated fatty acids was significantly decreased at day 14 under pH7.8, and this percentage gave a significant increase of proportion within one week under pH7.6. Furthermore, the relative content of total polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) was found to be clearly increased with exposure to different seawater acidification at day 1, suggesting that the brine shrimp immune response was likely to be affected by acidified seawater as the PUFAs have been well known to be involved in immunomodulatory effects through alterations on cell membrane fluidity/lipid mediators and gene expression of cell signaling pathways. Notably, eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid, which have essential effect on various physiological processes such as inflammatory cytokines production and cell structural stability, were strongly increased under two lower pH treatments within one week and with the significant increase at day 1 under pH7.6. These data clearly supported the hypothesis that OA might affect fatty acids composition, likely also the innate immunity, in crustacean and the subsequent energy transfer by food-chain system in the marine ecosystem.\n",

In the presence of even fatty acids, PHA contained not only the corresponding molecules (hydroxyhexanoate and hydroxyoctanoate), but also hydroxyvalerate; synthesis of four-component PHA which contain mainly hydroxybutyrate and hydroxyhexanoate (up to 18 mol %) is therefore possible.

Effects of H+ secreting mechanisms on unidirectional passage of the short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) acetate, propionate and n-butyrate across isolated guinea-pig caecum, proximal and distal colon were studied under short-circuit current conditions in Ussing chamber isotope flux experiments. 2. In the caecum and the proximal colon the serosal-to-mucosal fluxes (Jsm) were higher than the mucosal-to-serosal fluxes (Jms). Thus a net secretion of SCFA was present in the caecum and proximal colon. The higher Jsm appears to be coupled to the Na+ gradient established by the basolateral membrane Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase, whereas Jms is related to the operation of an apical membrane Na(+)-H+ exchanger. Inhibition of Na(+)-H+ exchange by amiloride (1 mM) added to the mucosal solution decreased Jms of SCFA in caecum and in proximal colon, but had no major effect in distal colon. 3. In distal colon Jms exceeds Jsm and thus a net absorption of SCFA was observed. Jms is Na+ independent and coupled to the activity of the apical membrane K(+)-H(+)-ATPase. Inhibition of the K(+)-H(+)-ATPase by addition of ouabain (0.1 mM) to the mucosal solution diminished Jms in the distal colon; in the caecum and proximal colon ouabain had no effect on Jms. 4. Neither amiloride nor ouabain caused major changes in Jsm in any of the large intestinal segments. 5. In conclusion, absorption of SCFA, e.g. Jms, in all large intestinal segments is related to the presence and activity of H+ secreting systems located in the apical membrane of colonocytes. In the caecum and proximal colon the predominant system appears to be Na(+)-H+ exchange, and in the distal colon K(+)-H(+)-ATPase. Supply of H+ ions allows protonation of SCFA anions and subsequent permeation by non-ionic diffusion across the apical membrane. These mechanisms account for 35, 40-50 and 60-80% of SCFA transport in the caecum, the proximal and the distal colon of guinea-pig, respectively. The nature of the Na(+)-dependent secretory pathway in the caecum and proximal colon remains to be determined.\n",

      "Mitochondria generate adenosine triphosphate (ATP) but also dangerous reactive oxygen species (ROS). One-electron reduction of dioxygen in the early stages of the electron transport chain yields a superoxide radical that is detoxified by mitochondrial superoxide dismutase to give hydrogen peroxide. The hydroxyl radical is derived from decomposition of hydrogen peroxide via the Fenton reaction, catalyzed by Fe2+ ions. Mitochondria require a constant supply of Fe2+ for heme and iron-sulfur cluster biosyntheses and therefore are particularly susceptible to ROS attack. Two main antioxidant defenses are known in mitochondria: enzymes that catalytically remove ROS, e.g. superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase, and low molecular weight agents that scavenge ROS, including coenzyme Q, glutathione, and vitamins E and C. An effective defensive system, however, should also involve means to control the availability of pro-oxidants such as Fe2+ ions. There is increasing evidence that this function may be carried out by the mitochondrial protein frataxin. Frataxin deficiency is the primary cause of Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA), an autosomal recessive degenerative disease. Frataxin is a highly conserved mitochondrial protein that plays a critical role in iron homeostasis. Respiratory deficits, abnormal cellular iron distribution and increased oxidative damage are associated with frataxin defects in yeast and mouse models of FRDA. The mechanism by which frataxin regulates iron metabolism is unknown. The yeast frataxin homologue (mYfh1p) is activated by Fe(II) in the presence of oxygen and assembles stepwise into a 48-subunit multimer (alpha48) that sequesters >2000 atoms of iron in a ferrihydrite mineral core. Assembly of mYfhlp is driven by two sequential iron oxidation reactions: a fast ferroxidase reaction catalyzed by mYfh1p induces the first assembly step (alpha --> alpha3), followed by a slower autoxidation reaction that promotes the assembly of higher order oligomers yielding alpha48. Depending on the ionic environment, stepwise assembly is associated with the sequestration of < or = 50-75 Fe(II)/subunit. This Fe(II) is initially loosely bound to mYfh1p and can be readily mobilized by chelators or made available to the mitochondrial enzyme ferrochelatase to synthesize heme. However, as iron oxidation and mineralization proceed, Fe(III) becomes progressively inaccessible and a stable iron-protein complex is produced. In conclusion, by coupling iron oxidation with stepwise assembly, frataxin can successively function as an iron chaperon or an iron store. Reduced iron availability and solubility and increased oxidative damage may therefore explain the pathogenesis of FRDA.\n",

      "Drought stress is the major limiting factor which affects turfgrass management in area with restricted rainfall or irrigation water supply. Trinexapac ethyl (TE), Paclobutrazol (PAC) and Abscisic acid (ABA) are three plant growth regulators (PGRs) that are commonly used on turf species for increasing their tolerance to different environmental stresses such as drought. However, little is known about the impact of PGRs on stress tolerance of Iranian Perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne). The present study was conducted to examine the visual and physiological changes of Iranian Perennial ryegrass in response to foliar application of TE, PAC, and ABA under drought stress conditions. According to the obtained results, application of all three PGRs considerably restored visual quality of drought exposed plants. TE treatment increased chlorophyll content, proline content and resulted in less malondialdehyde (MDA) in drought stressed Perennial ryegrass. Application of all PGRs enhanced the relative water content (RWC) and decreased the electrolyte leakage (EL) and Hydrogen peroxide contents (H2O2 content) of plants under drought stress, though the impact of TE was more pronounced. Throughout the experiment, TE- and ABA-treated plant showed greater soluble sugar (SSC) content as compared to the control. Antioxidant enzymes activities of drought exposed plants were considerably increased by PGRs application. Catalase (CAT) and Superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities were greater in TE-treated grasses followed by PAC-treated plants. Ascorbate peroxidase (APX) and peroxidase (POD) activities were significantly enhanced by TE and ABA application. The results of the present investigation suggest that application of TE, ABA and PAC enhances drought tolerance in Perennial ryegrass. TE, PAC and ABA were all effective in mitigating physiological damages resulting from drought stress, however the beneficial effects of TE were more pronounced. The result obtained of real time-PCR suggested that regulation of CAT, APX, POD and SOD genes expression at translational levels highly depended on the application of TE, PAC and ABA. Also, the results showed that deletion mutation in SOD and POD genes were not leading to enzyme inactivation.\n",

This enzyme used solar energy to power the thermodynamically and chemically demanding reaction of water splitting. In so doing it provided biology with an unlimited supply of hydrogen equivalents needed to convert carbon dioxide into the organic molecules of life. The enzyme, which facilitates this reaction and therefore underpins virtually all life on our planet, is known as Photosystem II (PSII). It is a multisubunit enzyme embedded in the lipid environment of the thylakoid membranes of plants, algae, and cyanobacteria. Over the past 10 years, crystal structures of a 700 kDa cyanobacterial dimeric PSII complex have been reported with ever increasing improvement in resolution with the latest being at 1.9 details of its many subunits and cofactors are now well understood. The water splitting site was revealed as a cluster of four Mn ions and a Ca ion surrounded by amino acid side chains, of which seven provide ligands to the metals. The metal cluster is organized as a cubane-like structure composed of three Mn ions and the Ca2+ linked by oxo-bonds with the fourth Mn attached to the cubane via one of its bridging oxygens together with another oxo bridge to a Mn ion of the cubane. The overall structure of the catalytic site is providing a framework on which to develop a mechanistic scheme for the water splitting process and gives a blue print and confidence for the development of catalysts for mimicking the reaction in an artificial photo-electrochemical system to generate solar fuels.\n",

At pH 5.5 and 0.6% peptide input, a high butyrate production coincided with decreasing acetate concentrations. The highest propionate concentrations (mean, 20.6 mM) occurred at pH 6.5 and 0.6% peptide input. In parallel, major bacterial groups were monitored by using fluorescence in situ hybridization with a panel of specific 16S rRNA probes. Bacteroides levels increased from ca. 20 to 75% of total eubacteria after a shift from pH 5.5 to 6.5, at 0.6% peptide, coinciding with high propionate formation. Conversely, populations of the butyrate-producing Roseburia group were highest (11 to 19%) at pH 5.5 but fell at pH 6.5, a finding that correlates with butyrate formation. When tested in batch culture, three Bacteroides species grew well at pH 6.7 but poorly at pH 5.5, which is consistent with the behavior observed for the mixed community. Two Roseburia isolates grew equally well at pH 6.7 and 5.5. These findings suggest that a lowering of pH resulting from substrate fermentation in the colon may boost butyrate production and populations of butyrate-producing bacteria, while at the same time curtailing the growth of Bacteroides spp.\n",

      "The effects of ruminal escape protein and added fat on ruminal characteristics were determined at 9, 4 and 1 wk prior to calving in 20 prepartum beef cows. Cows grazed native foothills range from mid-December to early March in two different years. Cows were randomly allotted to five groups (four cows per group) and fed (g/d) either no supplement (control); 570 soybean meal (SOY); 450 soybean meal and 230 blood meal (SOY+BM); 140 soybean meal, 16 urea and 450 corn gluten mean (SOY+CGM); or 570 soybean meal and 210 animal fat (SOY+FAT). Supplements were designed to supply similar quantities of ruminally degraded protein while varying in escape protein quantity and source (SOY+BM and SOY+CGM). Control animals had the lowest (P less than .03) ruminal ammonia concentration (4.5 to 8.9 mg/dl), but values were similar (8.1 to 12.3 mg/dl) for the other treatments. In both trials, NDF disappearance rate was lowest for the control, 1.85%/h (P less than .01), and tended to be lower (P less than .07) in SOY (2.25%/h) than for the mean of SOY+BM and SOY+CGM (2.62 and 2.84%/h). Ruminal fluid volume tended to be greater (P less than .14) and dilution rate lower (P less than .13) for the mean of SOY+BM and SOY+CGM than for SOY in both trials. Particulate dilution rate was lower (P less than .01) for the mean of SOY+BM and SOY+CGM (2.33 and 2.75%/h) than for SOY+FAT (3.17%/h) in Trial 2. These results indicate that supplemental escape protein from blood meal or corn gluten meal can influence ruminal characteristics, perhaps due to a continuous release of amino acids and(or) branched-chain organic acids.\n",

      "10.1093/bioinformatics/btm121\n",
      " \n",
      "MOTIVATION: Many evolutionarily distant, but functionally meaningful links between proteins come to light through comparison of spatial structures. Most programs that assess structural similarity compare two proteins to each other and find regions in common between them. Structural classification experts look for a particular structural motif instead. Programs base similarity scores on superposition or closeness of either Cartesian coordinates or inter-residue contacts. Experts pay more attention to the general orientation of the main chain and mutual spatial arrangement of secondary structural elements. There is a need for a computational tool to find proteins with the same secondary structures, topological connections and spatial architecture, regardless of subtle differences in 3D coordinates. RESULTS: We developed ProSMoS--a Protein Structure Motif Search program that emulates an expert. Starting from a spatial structure, the program uses previously delineated secondary structural elements. A meta-matrix of interactions between the elements (parallel or antiparallel) minding handedness of connections (left or right) and other features (e.g. element lengths and hydrogen bonds) is constructed prior to or during the searches. All structures are reduced to such meta-matrices that contain just enough information to define a protein fold, but this definition remains very general and deviations in 3D coordinates are tolerated. User supplies a meta-matrix for a structural motif of interest, and ProSMoS finds all proteins in the protein data bank (PDB) that match the meta-matrix. ProSMoS performance is compared to other programs and is illustrated on a beta-Grasp motif. A brief analysis of all beta-Grasp-containing proteins is presented. Program availability: ProSMoS is freely available for non-commercial use from ftp://iole.swmed.edu/pub/ProSMoS.\n",

      " \n",
      "Gallbladder fluid and electrolyte transport was investigatedin vitro. In guinea pig gallbladder, equimolar substitution of acetate, propionate, butyrate or valerate for HCO3 was increasingly effective in stimulating fluid absorption. The stimulatory potency of these compounds was a function of their chloroform water partition coefficients. The stimulatory effects of the isomers isobutyrate and isovalerate were less than predicted from their partition coefficients. Acidification of the gallbladder lumen, however, was strictly dependent on the partition coefficients for all of the above fatty acids. Unidirectional22Na fluxes were measured in rabbit and guinea pig gallbladders under short-circuit conditions. In the presence of butyrate stimulation of net Na flux was due entirely to an increase in the mucosal-to-serosal Na flux. Stimulation by butyrate was abolished by its omission from the mucosal bathing solution. The transepithelial electrical potential difference in both rabbit and guinea pig gallbladder became more lumen positive following mucosal but not serosal addition of butyrate. Net14C-butyrate fluxes were too small to account for stimulation of Na absorption in either species. Butyrate stimulation of Na absorption by guinea pig gallbladder was abolished by increasing the bathing pH from 7.4 to 8.1. Tris buffer (25mm) partially inhibited butyrate-dependent gallbladder fluid absorption by rabbit and guinea pig at pH 6.4 and 7.0, respectively, and completely at pH 8.4. These results reveal a marked similarity between butyrate and HCO3 stimulation of gallbladder NaCl and fluid absorption. The results are best explained by a double ion-exchange model, in which butyrate (HCO3) in the mucosal solution acts to maintain the intracellular supply of H+ and butyrate (HCO3) for countertransport of Na and Cl, respectively.\n",

      "Ocoee Lake No. 3 is the first reservoir receiving suspended sediments contaminated with trace metals discharged by acid mine effluents from the Ducktown Mining District, Tennessee. Bottom sediments (0-5 cm) from the lake were sampled to assess the potential for future adverse environmental effects if no remediation controls or activities are implemented. The sediments were found to include a major component (173 +/- 19 g kg(-1)) that dissolved in 6 mol L(-1) HCl within 24 h. This acid-soluble and relatively labile fraction contained high concentrations of Fe (460 +/- 40 g kg(-1)), Al (99 +/- 11 g kg(-1)), Mn (10 +/- 8 g kg(-1)), Cu (2000 +/- 700 mg kg(-1)), Zn (1300 +/- 200 mg kg(-1)), and Pb (300 +/- 200 mg kg(-1)). When the pH of water in contact with the sediment was decreased experimentally from 6.4 to 2.6, the concentrations of dissolved trace metals increased by factors of 2200 for Pb, 160 for Cu, 21 for Zn, 9 for Cd, 8 for Ni, and 5 for Co. The order in which metals were released with decreasing pH was the reverse of that reported for pH-dependent sorption of these metals in upstream systems. Substantial release of trace metals from the sediment was observed even by a modest decrease of pH from 6.4 to 5.9. Therefore, the metal-rich sediment of the lake should be considered as potentially hazardous to bottom-dwelling aquatic species and other organisms in the local food chain. In addition, if the reservoir is dredged or if the dam is removed, the accumulated sediment may have to be treated for recovery of sorbed metals.\n",

      "Water treatment residuals (WTRs) produced in large quantities during deironing and demanganization of infiltration water, due to high content of iron and manganese oxides, exhibit excellent sorptive properties toward arsenate and arsenite. Nonetheless, since they consist of microparticles, their practical use as an adsorbent is limited by difficulties with separation from treated solutions. The aim of this study was entrapment of chemically pretreated WTR into calcium alginate polymer and examination of sorptive properties of the obtained composite sorbent toward As(III) and As(V). Different products were formed varying in WTR content as well as in density of alginate matrix. In order to determine the key parameters of the adsorption process, both equilibrium and kinetic studies were conducted. The best properties were exhibited by a sorbent containing 5 % residuals, formed in alginate solution with a concentration of 1 %. In slightly acidic conditions (pH 4.5), its maximum sorption capacity was 3.4 and 2.9 mg g−1 for As(III) and As(V), respectively. At neutral pH, the adsorption effectiveness decreased to 3.3 mg As g−1 for arsenites and to 0.7 mg As g−1 for arsenates. The presence of carboxylic groups in polymer chains impeded in neutral conditions the diffusion of anions into sorbent beads; therefore, the main rate-limiting step of the adsorption, mainly in the case of arsenates, was intraparticle diffusion. The optimal condition for simultaneous removal of arsenates and arsenites from water by means of the obtained composite sorbent is slightly acidic pH, ensuring similar adsorption effectiveness for both arsenic species.\n",

      "Isoelectric focusing of human globin chains in polyacrylamide gels dried in the ambient atmosphere and rehydrated in the presence of 8 mol/L urea produces artefactual doublets of zones as a result of oxidation by the gel. This oxidation can be avoided in separations of short duration by adding a reducing agent (e.g. 2-mercaptoethanol or dithiothreitol to the rehydration solution (Altland, K. and Rossmann, U., Electrophoresis 1985, 6, 314-325). We now demonstrate that the observed zone doublets can be explained by assuming neutralization of the contribution of dissociated sulfhydryl group of cysteine to pI by partial and reversible formation of globin dimers held together by disulfide bridges. Long time separations, requiring e.g. more than 4 h at greater than or equal to 500 V/cm, in pH gradients exceeding pH 7.5, are accompanied by artefactual oxidation from both the atmosphere and the gel matrix. Oxidation from the atmosphere as well as the effect of carbon dioxide can be eliminated by overlayering the gel with paraffin oil. Oxidation from the gel matrix can only partially be inhibited by rehydration of gels in the presence of 2-mercaptoethanol or dithiothreitol. Nearly complete protection against oxidation by the gel matrix was achieved by adding a permanent supply of 2-ME to the gel or by adding DTT to the cathodic wick towards the end of the experiment. Alkylation with iodoacetamide or iodoacetic acid resulted in stable globin patterns, which, however, displayed additional artefactual zones. Our experimental data indicate that the polyacrylamide gels function as an electron acceptor for dissociated sulfhydryl groups in proteins, even after pretreatment with strong reducing agents for proteins.\n",

      " \n",
      "In our previous study, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) evidence of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in Carassius auratus following 2-chlorophenol (2-CP) administration was provided. To further investigate the potential pathway of ROS production, liver mitochondria of C. auratus was isolated and incubated with 2-CP for 30 min. An EPR analysis indicated ROS was produced, and intensities of ROS increased with increasing concentrations of 2-CP. The ROS was then assigned OH by comparing with Fenton reaction. Either catalase or superoxide dismutase, extinguished OH completely in the mitochondria mixture. These facts suggested that O2(.-) and H2O2 contributed to the formation of OH in mitochondria in C. auratus stressed by 2-CP. Combining previous references and our own data, it is reasonable to suggest that 2-CP is first oxidized by H2O2 present in vivo to form phenoxyl radical under the catalytic action of cellular peroxidase (1); phenoxyl radical oxidizes mitochondria NADH to NAD in the presence of NADH (2); NAD reacts with oxygen in vivo to produce O2(.-) (3); O2(.-) is spontaneously dismutated by SOD to form H2O2 and O2, which creates a renewable supply of H2O2 as the initiators of the chain reactions until NADH is consumed (4); simultaneously with reaction (4), O2(.-) reacts with H2O2 to form OH radical via the Haber-Weiss reaction (5). A strong negative correlation (r=-0.9278, p<0.01) between glutathione (GSH) pool and OH production was observed after fish were i.p. injected with 2-CP (250 mg kg(-1)), indicating the depletion of GSH caused by OH.\n",

      " \n",
      "HP1286 from Helicobacter pylori is among the proteins that play a relevant role in bacterial colonization and persistence in the stomach. Indeed, it was demonstrated to be overexpressed under acidic stress conditions, together with other essential virulence factors. Here we describe its crystal structure, determined at 2.1 A resolution. The molecular model, a dimer characterized by two-fold symmetry, shows that HP1286 structurally belongs to the YceI-like protein family, which in turn is characterized by the lipocalin fold. The latter characterizes proteins possessing an internal cavity with the function of binding and/or transport of amphiphilic molecules. Surprisingly, a molecule of erucamide was found bound in the internal cavity of each monomer of recombinant HP1286, cloned and expressed in an Escherichia coli heterologous system. The shape and length of the cavity indicate that, at variance with other members of the family, HP-YceI has a binding specificity for amphiphilic compounds with a linear chain of about 22 carbon atoms. These features, along with the fact that the protein is secreted by the bacterium and is involved in adaptation to an acidic environment, suggest that its function could be that of sequestering specific fatty acids or amides from the environment, either to supply the bacterium with the fatty acids necessary for its metabolism, or to protect and detoxify it from the detergent-like antimicrobial activity of fatty acids that are eventually present in the external milieu.\n",

      " \n",
      "The tumor host microenvironment is increasingly viewed as an important contributor to tumor growth and suppression. Cellular oxidative stress resulting from high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) contributes to various processes involved in the development and progress of malignant tumors including carcinogenesis, aberrant growth, metastasis, and angiogenesis. In this regard, the stroma induces oxidative stress in adjacent tumor cells, and this in turn causes several changes in tumor cells including modulation of the redox status, inhibition of cell proliferation, and induction of apoptotic or necrotic cell death. Because the levels of ROS are determined by a balance between ROS generation and ROS detoxification, disruption of this system will result in increased or decreased ROS level. Recently, we demonstrated that the control of mitochondrial redox balance and cellular defense against oxidative damage is one of the primary functions of mitochondrial NADP(+)-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH2) that supplies NADPH for antioxidant systems. To explore the interactions between tumor cells and the host, we evaluated tumorigenesis between IDH2-deficient (knock-out) and wild-type mice in which B16F10 melanoma cells had been implanted. Suppression of B16F10 cell tumorigenesis was reproducibly observed in the IDH2-deficient mice along with significant elevation of oxidative stress in both the tumor and the stroma. In addition, the expression of angiogenesis markers was significantly down-regulated in both the tumor and the stroma of the IDH2-deficient mice. These results support the hypothesis that redox status-associated changes in the host environment of tumor-bearing mice may contribute to cancer progression.\n",

      " \n",
      "Dynamic models complement existing time series of observations and static critical load calculations by simulating past and future development of chemistry in forest and lake ecosystems. They are used for dynamic assessment of the acidification and to produce target load functions, that describe what combinations of nitrogen and sulfur emission reductions are needed to achieve a chemical or biological criterion in a given target year. The Swedish approach has been to apply the dynamic acidification models MAGIC, to 133 lakes unaffected by agriculture and SAFE, to 645 productive forest sites. While the long-term goal is to protect 95% of the area, implementation of the Gothenburg protocol will protect approximately 75% of forest soils in the long term. After 2030, recovery will be very slow and involve only a limited geographical area. If there had been no emission reductions after 1980, 87% of the forest area would have unwanted soil status in the long term. In 1990, approximately 17% of all Swedish lakes unaffected by agriculture received an acidifying deposition above critical load. This fraction will decrease to 10% in 2010 after implementation of the Gothenburg protocol. The acidified lakes of Sweden will recover faster than the soils. According to the MAGIC model the median pre-industrial ANC of 107 microeq L(-1) in acid sensitive lakes decreased to about 60 microeq L(-1) at the peak of the acidification (1975-1990) and increases to 80 microeq L(-1) by 2010. Further increases were small, only 2 microeq L(-1) between 2010 and 2040. Protecting 95% of the lakes will require further emission reductions below the Gothenburg protocol levels. More than 7000 lakes are limed regularly in Sweden and it is unlikely that this practice can be discontinued in the near future without adverse effects on lake chemistry and biology.\n",

      "Biofiltration of industrial carbon disulfide (CS2)-contaminated waste air streams results in the acidification of biofilters and therefore reduced performance, high water use, and increased costs. To address these issues, we isolated 16 extremely acidophilic CS2-converting Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans strains that tolerated up to 6% (vol/vol) sulfuric acid. The ecophysiological properties of five selected strains (2Bp, Sts 4-3, S1p, G8, and BBW1) were compared. These five strains had pH optima between 1 (2Bp) and 2 (S1p). Their affinities for CS2 ranged between 80 (G8) and 130 (2Bp) μM. Strains S1p, G8, and BBW1 had more hydrophobic cell surfaces and produced less extracellular polymeric substance than did strains 2Bp and Sts 4-3. All five strains converted about 80% of the S added as CS2 to S(0) when CS2 was supplied in excess. The rate of S(0) consumption varied between 7 (Sts 4-3) and 63 (S1p) nmol O2 min(-1) ml culture(-1). Low S(0) consumption rates correlated partly with low levels of cell attachment to externally produced S(0) globules. During chemostat growth, the relative amount of CS2 hydrolase in the cell increased with decreasing growth rates. This resulted in more S(0) accumulation during CS2 overloads at low growth rates. Intermittent interruptions of the CS2 supply affected all five strains. Strains S1p, G8, and BBW1 recovered from 24 h of starvation within 4 h, and strains 2Bp and Sts 4-3 recovered within 24 h after CS2 was resupplied. We recommend the use of mixtures of Acidithiobacillus strains in industrial biofilters.\n",

      "Growth of trophoblast tissue in early pregnancy is rapid and accomplished in an unusually hypoxic environment. Hypoxia has been reported to upregulate mRNA production of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and VEGF receptors have been found on trophoblast cells. These observations suggest that VEGF may have an important role in early placentation. This study examines the influence of hypoxia on both the production of the VEGF message and protein and on the production of human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) protein by the cell lines JEG, JAr and BeWo. Cells were grown under normoxic and hypoxic conditions for 72 h. The average oxygen tension in the culture media of the hypoxic cultures (6-7 kPa) was significantly less than in the normoxic cultures (19-21 kPa). RNA was extracted and message for VEGF(121), VEGF(165) and VEGF(189) found in all cell lines by reverse transcription and the polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). These messages were upregulated by hypoxia; findings confirmed by competitive PCR for VEGF and expression of the house keeping gene GAPDH. hCG and VEGF were measured by immunoassay. Hypoxia resulted in an increase in VEGF production (P<0.05) but had inconsistent effects on hCG production. In some experiments the absolute concentrations of hCG and VEGF in the culture media were noted to be significantly correlated (r>0.5, P<0.05). In addition to its role in angiogenesis, VEGF may have direct effects on trophoblast cells encouraging proliferation and invasion. These effects may be regulated in part through oxygen supply and hCG.\n",

      "Astrocytes can tolerate longer periods of oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) as compared to neurons. The reasons for this reduced vulnerability are not well understood. Particularly, changes in mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψ(m)) in astrocytes, an indicator of the cellular redox state, have not been investigated during reperfusion after extended OGD exposure. Here, we subjected primary mouse astrocytes to glucose deprivation (GD), OGD and combinations of both conditions varying in duration and sequence. Changes in Δψ(m), visualized by change in the fluorescence of JC-1, were investigated within one hour after reconstitution of oxygen and glucose supply, intended to model in vivo reperfusion. In all experiments, astrocytes showed resilience to extended periods of OGD, which had little effect on Δψ(m) during reperfusion, whereas GD caused a robust Δψ(m) negativation. In case no Δψ(m) negativation was observed after OGD, subsequent chemical oxygen deprivation (OD) induced by sodium azide caused depolarization, which, however, was significantly delayed as compared to normoxic group. When GD preceded OD for 12 h, Δψ(m) hyperpolarization was induced by both GD and subsequent OD, but significant interaction between these conditions was not detected. However, when GD was extended to 48 h preceding OGD, hyperpolarization enhanced during reperfusion. This implicates synergistic effects of both conditions in that sequence. These findings provide novel information regarding the role of the two main substrates of electron transport chain (glucose and oxygen) and their hyperpolarizing effect on Δψ(m) during substrate deprivation, thus shedding new light on mechanisms of astrocyte resilience to prolonged ischemic injury.\n",

      "Human enteric viruses can contaminate municipal drinking-water wells, but few studies have examined the routes by which viruses enter these wells. In the present study, the objective was to monitor the municipal wells of La Crosse, Wisconsin, for enteric viruses and determine whether the amount of Mississippi River water infiltrating the wells was related to the frequency of virus detection. From March 2001 to February 2002, one river water site and four wells predicted by hydrogeological modeling to have variable degrees of surface water contributions were sampled monthly for enteric viruses, microbial indicators of sanitary quality, and oxygen and hydrogen isotopes. (18)O/(16)O and (2)H/(1)H ratios were used to determine the level of surface water contributions. All samples were collected prior to chlorination at the wellhead. By reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR), 24 of 48 municipal well water samples (50%) were positive for enteric viruses, including enteroviruses, rotavirus, hepatitis A virus (HAV), and noroviruses. Of 12 river water samples, 10 (83%) were virus positive by RT-PCR. Viable enteroviruses were not detected by cell culture in the well samples, although three well samples were positive for culturable HAV. Enteroviruses detected in the wells by RT-PCR were identified as several serotypes of echoviruses and group A and group B coxsackieviruses. None of the well water samples was positive for indicators of sanitary quality, namely male-specific and somatic coliphages, total coliform bacteria, Escherichia coli, and fecal enterococci. Contrary to expectations, viruses were found in all wells regardless of the level of surface water contributions. This result suggests that there were other unidentified sources, in addition to surface water, responsible for the contamination.\n",

      "Early signals potentially regulating leaf growth and stomatal aperture in field-grown maize (Zea mays L.) subjected to drought were investigated. Plants grown in a field lysimeter on two soil types were subjected to progressive drought during vegetative growth. Leaf ABA content, water status, extension rate, conductance, photosynthesis, nitrogen content, and xylem sap composition were measured daily. Maize responded similarly to progressive drought on both soil types. Effects on loam were less pronounced than on sand. Relative to fully-watered controls, xylem pH increased by about 0.2 units one day after withholding irrigation (DAWI) and conductivity decreased by about 0.25 mS cm(-1) 1-3 DAWI. Xylem nitrate, ammonium, and phosphate concentrations decreased by about 50% at 1-5 DAWI and potassium concentration decreased by about 50% at 7-8 DAWI. Xylem ABA concentration consistently increased by 45-70 pmol ml(-1) at 7 DAWI. Leaf extension rate decreased 5 DAWI, after the changes in xylem chemical composition had occurred. Leaf nitrogen significantly decreased 8-16 DAWI in droughted plants. Midday leaf water potential and photosynthesis were significantly decreased in droughted plants late in the drying period. Xylem nitrate concentration was the only ionic xylem sap component significantly correlated to increasing soil moisture deficit and decreasing leaf nitrogen concentration. Predawn leaf ABA content in droughted plants increased by 100-200 ng g(-1) dry weight at 7 DAWI coinciding with a decrease in stomatal conductance before any significant decrease in midday leaf water potential was observed. Based on the observed sequence, a chain of signal events is suggested eventually leading to stomatal closure and leaf surface reduction through interactive effects of reduced nitrogen supply and plant growth regulators under drought.\n",

      "The photoproduction of organic peroxides (ROOH) in photosystem II (PSII) membranes was studied using the fluorescent probe Spy-HP. Two types of peroxide, highly lipophilic ones and relatively hydrophilic ones, were distinguished by the rate of reaction with Spy-HP; the former oxidized Spy-HP to the higher fluorescent form Spy-HPOx within 5 min, while the latter did so very slowly (the reaction was still not completed after 180 min). The level of photoproduction of these peroxides was significantly larger in the alkaline-treated, Mn-depleted PSII membranes than that in the untreated membranes, and it was suppressed by an artificial electron donor (diphenylcarbazide or ferrocyanide) and by the electron transport inhibitor diuron. Postillumination addition of Fe(2+) ions, which degrade peroxides by the Fenton mechanism, abolished the accumulation of Spy-HPOx, but catalase did not change the peroxide level, indicating that the detected species were organic peroxides, excluding H(2)O(2). These results agreed with our previous observation of an electron transport-dependent O(2) consumption on the PSII donor side and indicated that ROOH accumulated via a radical chain reaction that started with the formation of organic radicals on the donor side. Illumination (λ > 600 nm; 1500 μmol of photons m(-2) s(-1)) of the Mn-depleted PSII membranes for 3 min resulted in the formation of nearly 200 molecules of hydrophilic ROOH per reaction center, but only four molecules of highly lipophilic ROOH. The limited formation of the latter was due to the limited supply of its precursor to the reaction, suggesting that it represented structurally fixed peroxides, i.e., either protein peroxides or peroxides of the lipids tightly bound to the core complex. These ROOH forms, likely including several species derived from lipid peroxides, may mediate the donor side-induced photoinhibition of PSII via protein modification.\n",

      "Patterns of Hg Bioaccumulation and Transfer in Aquatic Food Webs Across Multi-lake Studies in the Northeast US\n",

      " \n",
      "The northeastern USA receives some of the highest levels of atmospheric mercury deposition of any region in North America. Moreover, fish from many lakes in this region carry Hg burdens that present health risks to both human and wildlife consumers. The overarching goal of this study was to identify the attributes of lakes in this region that are most likely associated with high Hg burdens in fish. To accomplish this, we compared data collected in four separate multi-lake studies. Correlations among Hg in fish (4 studies) or in zooplankton and fish (2 studies) and numerous chemical, physical, land use, and ecological variables were compared across more than 150 lakes. The analysis produced three general findings. First, the most important predictors of Hg burdens in fish were similar among datasets. As found in past studies, key chemical covariates (e.g., pH, acid neutralizing capacity, and SO4) were negatively correlated with Hg bioaccumulation in the biota. However, negative correlations with several parameters that have not been previously identified (e.g., human land use variables and zooplankton density) were also found to be equally important predictors. Second, certain predictors were unique to individual datasets and differences in lake population characteristics, sampling protocols, and fish species in each study likely explained some of the contrasting results that we found in the analyses. Third, lakes with high rates of Hg bioaccumulation and trophic transfer have low pH and low productivity with relatively undisturbed watersheds suggesting that atmospheric deposition of Hg is the dominant or sole source of input. This study highlights several fundamental complexities when comparing datasets over different environmental conditions but also underscores the utility of such comparisons for revealing key drivers of Hg trophic transfer among different types of lakes.\n",

      " \n",
      "Segments of guinea pig jejunum, proximal and distal colon and of rat jejunum were superfused either in vivo or in vitro with different electrolyte solutions. The pH in the bulk phase solution and at the surface of the epithelium was measured with two different types of glass pH-microelectrodes, a pointed tip (Hinke-type) and a flat membrane electrode (Dubuisson-type); both types of electrodes gave the same results.The existence of a pH-microclimate at the surface of the mucosa was demonstrated under both in vivo and in vitro conditions. In vivo the pH-microclimate was stable and virtually independent of changes in the luminal bulk phase pH. When the bulk phase pH of the guinea pig colon was changed between pH 5 and pH 8.6, the mean pH in the microclimate was 7.08±0.15 (n=163) in the proximal colon and 6.91±0.14 (n=75) in the distal colon. In the guinea pig jejunum pH in the microclimate was 7.37±0.21 (n=10) while the luminal pH was 7.27±0.10.Under in vitro conditions, the pH in the microclimate was more acidic (guinea pig jejunum ΔpH 0.93, rat jejunum ΔpH 0.40, guinea pig proximal colon ΔpH 0.22).Addition of glucose (10 mM) or short-chain fatty acids (80–90 mM) to the luminal solution or replacement of sodium by lithium did not influence the pH in the microclimate significantly. Also the addition of acetazolamide, amiloride, SITS or sodium deoxycholate to the luminal solution, did not affect the pH in the microclimate in vivo. A temporary interruption of the blood supply caused acidification of the pH in the microclimate. Restoring the blood flow reversed the effect, and the pH returned to the original values within a few minutes.The originally proposed acid-microclimate could not be confirmed under in vivo experimental conditions either in the jejunum or in the colon by direct measurement with pH-sensitive glass-microelectrodes.\n",

      " \n",
      "Soil acidity, associated with aluminium (Al) toxicity and low phosphorus (P) availability, is considered the most important problem for agricultural production. Even though the Al-P interaction has been widely investigated, the impact of P-nutrition on Al-toxicity still remains controversial and poorly understood. To elucidate further insights into the underlying mechanisms of this interaction in ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.), P uptake, antioxidant responses and the gene expression of phosphate transporters were determined. Two ryegrass cultivars with different Al resistances, the Al-tolerant Nui cultivar and the Al-sensitive Expo cultivar were hydroponically grown under low (16 μM) and optimal (100 μM) P doses for 16 days. After P treatments, plants were exposed to Al doses (0 and 200 μM) under acidic conditions (pH 4.8) for 24 h. Al and P accumulation were higher in the roots of Nui than that of Expo. Moreover, lower Al accumulation was found in shoots of Nui independent of P supplies. Oxidative stress induced by Al-toxicity and P-deficiency was more severe in the Al-sensitive Expo. Expression levels of L. perenne phosphate transporters were higher in Nui than they were in Expo. While LpPHT1 expression was up-regulated by P deficiency and Al toxicity in both cultivars, LpPHT4 expression only increased in the Al-tolerant cultivar. This report shows that the higher Al-tolerance of Nui can be attributed to a greater antioxidant system under both P conditions. The observation of higher P and Al accumulation in roots of Nui might indicate that the Al-tolerance of Nui is a consequence of Al immobilization by P mediated by the high expression of phosphate transporters.\n",

      "10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.08.136\n",
      " \n",
      "Macrophytes are shown to affect the microbial activity in different aqueous environments, with an altering of the sediment cycling of mercury (Hg) as a potential effect. Here, we investigated how a meadow with permanently submerged macrophytes in a contaminated brackish fjord in southern Norway influenced the conditions for sulfate reducing microbial activity, the methyl-Hg (MeHg) production and the availability of MeHg. Historically discharged Hg from a chlor-alkali plant (60-80tons, 1947-1987) was evident through high Hg concentrations (491mgTot-Hgkg-1, 268μgMeHgkg-1) in intermediate sediment depths (10-20cm) outside of the meadow, with reduced concentrations within the meadow. Natural recovery of the fjord was revealed by lower sediment surface concentrations (1.9-15.5mgTot-Hgkg-1, 1.3-3.2μgMeHgkg-1). Within the meadow, vertical gradients of sediment hydrogen sulfide (H2S) Eh and pH suggested microbial sulfate reduction in 2-5cm depths, coinciding with peak values of relative MeHg levels (0.5% MeHg). We assume that MeHg production rates was stimulated by the supply and availability of organic carbon, microbial activity and a sulfide oxidizing agent (e.g. O2) within the rhizosphere. Following this, % MeHg in sediment (0-5cm) within the meadow was approximately 10× higher compared to outside the meadow. Further, enhanced availability of MeHg within the meadow was demonstrated by significantly higher fluxes (p<0.01) from sediment to overlying water (0.1-0.6ngm-2d-1) compared to sediment without macrophytes (0.02-0.2ngm-2d-1). Considering the productivity and species richness typical for such habitats, submerged macrophyte meadows located within legacy Hg contaminated sediment sites may constitute important entry points for MeHg into food webs.\n",

      "10.1054/mehy.1997.0696\n",
      " \n",
      "In studies of oxidative stress in sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) there were two major findings: (1) During normal post-natal development, there was a gradual decline in the number of Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSHPx) immunoreactive neurons in the hippocampus and parahippocampus gyrus in the brain; (2) The total number of immunoreactive neurons was elevated in SIDS victims compared to age-matched controls in infants 6 months of age and under (1). SOD and neuronal aging and degeneration in the hippocampus and neocortex were features of SIDS, Alzheimer's disease and Down's syndrome. In the SIDS study of infants from 3-6 months of age, the elevation of SOD in SIDS victims was significant, whereas no significant elevation of GSHPx was detected. An imbalance between SOD and GSHPx was said to be crucial in the prevention of toxicity of free radicals (1). Zinc-deficient cells cannot up-regulate gene expression of the scavenger enzymes SOD and GSHPx in cells exposed to high levels of superoxide and hydrogen peroxide (2). GSHPx coupled to reduced nicotine adenine diphosphate (NADPH) regenerating systems via glutathione reductase is virtually able to guarantee an effective protection of biological structures against oxidative attack (22). When the capacity of the cell to regenerate GSH is exceeded - primarily due to an insufficient supply of NADPH-oxidised glutathione (GSSG) is released from the cell and protein synthesis turns off (20). We hypothesize that the increased incidence of aging and neuronal death and increased incidence of SOD and GSHPx reactive neurons in early post-natal development indicates an increased up-regulation of gene expression of scavenger enzymes during high exposure to oxidative stress after birth. GSH-dependent peroxide metabolism is linked to the pentose phosphate shunt via NADPH-dependent glutathione reductase (GR). GSHPx is a selenium containing enzyme which together with catalase (CAT) SOD and vitamin E protects cells in the free radical chain. Zinc upregulates gene expression of these antioxidants.\n",

      " \n",
      "Summary: Oxygen equilibrium curves of partially autoxidized adult (HbA) and fetal hemoglobins (HbF) were determined at 2–75% methemoglobin (met-Hb). Hemoglobin concentration of 5 mM, pH 7.15 (Tris 0.05 M), and temperature of 37° corresponded to intraerythrocytic in vivo conditions. With increasing met-Hb fractions the curves became shifted to the left and approached a hyperbolic form: P50 of both HbA and HbF decreased in absence of 2, 3-diphosphoglycerate (2, 3-DPG) from about 13 to 7 Torr, and Hill's n from 2.7 to 1.25. Independent of the met-Hb fraction the alkaline Bohr effect was increased by 2, 3-DPG. The allosteric effect of 2, 3-DPG on P50 decreased with increasing met-Hb. At all oxidation levels this effect was smaller on HbF than on HbA: At 50% met-Hb P50 of HbF is increased by 0.7 Torr/mM 2, 3-DPG increase, P50 of HbA by 1.3 Torr, respectively. There was no evidence of preferential autoxidation of α or non-α chains of the hemoglobin molecule.Oxidized hemoglobin does not take part in oxygen transport. In addition a left-shifted, more hyperbolic curve means restricted oxygen unloading from the remaining active hemoglobin. Thus, from application of our results to clinical conditions it must be concluded that sustained methemoglobinemia, despite partial compensation by 2, 3-DPG, may interfere with oxygen supply to tissue, particularly in the perinatal period, when HbF prevails.Speculation: Tissue oxygen supply, as calculated from the present data on O2 capacity, P50, 2, 3-DPG reactivity, Hill's n, and Bohr factors, appears to be markedly lowered in methemoglobinemia, particularly in presence of fetal hemoglobin. Reduced tissue oxygen supply in the perinatal period, in addition to a generalized cytochrome b5 reductase deficiency (22), might contribute to irreversable cerebral dysfunction in hereditary methemoglobinemia.\n",

      "10.3168/jds.2008-1480\n",
      " \n",
      "Replacing dietary starch with sugar has been reported to improve production in dairy cows. Two sets of 24 Holstein cows averaging 41 kg/d of milk were fed a covariate diet, blocked by days in milk, and randomly assigned in 2 phases to 4 groups of 6 cows each. Cows were fed experimental diets containing [dry matter (DM) basis]: 39% alfalfa silage, 21% corn silage, 21% rolled high-moisture shelled corn, 9% soybean meal, 2% fat, 1% vitamin-mineral supplement, 7.5% supplemental nonstructural carbohydrate, 16.7% crude protein, and 30% neutral detergent fiber. Nonstructural carbohydrates added to the 4 diets were 1) 7.5% corn starch, 0% sucrose; 2) 5.0% starch, 2.5% sucrose; 3) 2.5% starch, 5.0% sucrose; or 4) 0% starch, 7.5% sucrose. Cows were fed the experimental diets for 8 wk. There were linear increases in DM intake and milk fat content and yield, and linear decreases in ruminal concentrations of ammonia and branched-chain volatile fatty acids, and urinary excretion of urea-N and total N, and urinary urea-N as a proportion of total N, as sucrose replaced corn starch in the diet. Despite these changes, there was no effect of diet on microbial protein formation, estimated from total purine flow at the omasum or purine derivative excretion in the urine, and there were linear decreases in both milk/DM intake and milk N/N-intake when sucrose replaced dietary starch. However, expressing efficiency as fat-corrected milk/DM intake or solids-corrected milk/DM intake indicated that there was no effect of sucrose addition on nutrient utilization. Replacing dietary starch with sucrose increased fat secretion, apparently via increased energy supply because of greater intake. Positive responses normally correlated with improved ruminal N efficiency that were altered by sucrose feeding were not associated with increased protein secretion in this trial.\n",

      "10.1080/10408398109527305\n",
      " \n",
      "Fish protein concentrates are mixtures of cross-linked and aggregated molecules of different muscle proteins. The final conformation of the components of the mixtures is formed as a result of procedures applied to convert the raw materials into a product of desirable and stable sensory properties, containing less than 0.1% of lipids. To achieve this end usually extraction with hot organic solvents, mainly isopropyl alcohol and 1,2-dichloroethene, followed by air drying are employed. These conditions bring about denaturation of many of the proteins followed by aggregation of the molecules due to the interaction of reactive functional groups in extended polypeptide chains. In the final product a large proportion of hydrophobic groups is exposed to the solvent and the proteins exhibit an extremely low water affinity. Such concentrates, although valuable as protein supplements, have only limited suitability as active components of various processed foods, as they have poor technological value. They are insoluble or have a very low water dispersibility and swelling ability, do not form gels after heating, or have any significant fat-emulsifying capacity. Changing the dissociation or number of ionic groups of the molecules prior to extraction, e.g., by acidifying or acylating, can partially reduce the denaturing effect of heat and organic solvents and thus improve the functional properties of the product. An upgrading of the quality of concentrates produced by hot extraction can be achieved by partial enzymatic or chemical deaggregation, hydrolysis followed by the plastein reaction, or formation of suitable derivatives. The best results have been obtained by partial hydrolysis of acylated proteins or precipitation of the aggregated products using sodium hexametaphosphate. The functional properties of such products are comparable to those of vegetable protein isolates used as meat extenders. Various proteins of high technological value can be also obtained by enzymatic hydrolysis of the raw material, followed by separation of the lipids without organic solvent extraction. Such products, however, have a distinct odor and flavor and must be stabilized because of residual lipids.\n",

      "Changing Dietary Cation-Anion Difference for Dairy Cows Fed with Two Contrasting Levels of Concentrate in Diets\n",

      " \n",
      "High-producing dairy cows are commonly fed diets containing a high proportion of rapidly degradable starch, which can cause subacute acidosis and reduce dry matter (DM) intake. Because of the properties of nonmetabolizable cations and anions, increasing the dietary cation-anion difference (DCAD = Na + K - Cl - S in mEq/kg of DM) may prevent a drop in DM intake. To test this hypothesis, 48 Holstein cows were blocked into 2 groups of 24 and assigned to two 3 x 3 Latin squares in a split-plot design. Each group received one level of concentrate at either 20% or 40% on a dry matter (DM) basis. The diet containing 20% concentrate was formulated to supply 4% rapidly degradable starch, whereas the diet containing 40% concentrate supplied 22% rapidly degradable starch. Diets in each square were formulated to provide a DCAD of 0, 150, or 300 mEq/kg of DM. The 3 values were obtained by manipulating Na and Cl contents. Intake, 4% fat-corrected milk yield, and milk fat percentage, as well as blood nonesterified fatty acids and beta-hydroxybutyrate increased with DCAD, but only on the diet providing 40% concentrate. The yield of trans-10 C(18:1) and odd-chain fatty acids decreased with increasing DCAD, whereas trans-11 C(18:1) increased. Again, this occurred only with the diet providing 40% concentrate. Blood pH and HCO(3) concentration increased along with DCAD, irrespective of the concentrate level. A positive DCAD led to increasing DM intake and fat-corrected milk yield in dairy cows fed highly degradable diets. The mechanism involved may be a localized rumen buffering effect, together with the ability of positive DCAD to maintain blood acid-base status in cows faced with a massive acid input.\n",

      "10.1128/jb.01683-07\n",
      " \n",
      "Patients suffering from cystic fibrosis (CF) commonly harbor the important pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa in their airways. During chronic late-stage CF, P. aeruginosa is known to grow under reduced oxygen tension and is even capable of respiring anaerobically within the thickened airway mucus, at a pH of approximately 6.5. Therefore, proteins involved in anaerobic metabolism represent potentially important targets for therapeutic intervention. In this study, the clinically relevant \"anaerobiome\" or \"proteogenome\" of P. aeruginosa was assessed. First, two different proteomic approaches were used to identify proteins differentially expressed under anaerobic versus aerobic conditions. Microarray studies were also performed, and in general, the anaerobic transcriptome was in agreement with the proteomic results. However, we found that a major portion of the most upregulated genes in the presence of NO(3)(-) and NO(2)(-) are those encoding Pf1 bacteriophage. With anaerobic NO(2)(-), the most downregulated genes are those involved postglycolytically and include many tricarboxylic acid cycle genes and those involved in the electron transport chain, especially those encoding the NADH dehydrogenase I complex. Finally, a signature-tagged mutagenesis library of P. aeruginosa was constructed to further screen genes required for both NO(3)(-) and NO(2)(-) respiration. In addition to genes anticipated to play important roles in the anaerobiome (anr, dnr, nar, nir, and nuo), the cysG and dksA genes were found to be required for both anaerobic NO(3)(-) and NO(2)(-) respiration. This study represents a major step in unraveling the molecular machinery involved in anaerobic NO(3)(-) and NO(2)(-) respiration and offers clues as to how we might disrupt such pathways in P. aeruginosa to limit the growth of this important CF pathogen when it is either limited or completely restricted in its oxygen supply.\n",

      "Performance of a full-scale wastewater treatment plant by rotating biological contactors (RBC) system was monitored during a year by physico-chemical and microbial characterisation. Six points along wastewater treatment were selected in the plant: three points along the water line (influent, sedimentation tank and effluent) and three points along RBC system (RBC1, RBC2 and RBC3). Although a large seasonal change in the values of physico-chemical parameters was observed, operation of the plant was optimal during all year (90% of removal in BOD5 and SS influent content). Microbial characterisation was approached by determining the structure and dynamics of protozoan and metazoan communities. Protozoa were the most abundant in all stages in the plant, heterotrophic flagellates being the most representative group in the water line and ciliates in the RBC system. The same seasonal preference was only observed for heterotrophic flagellates in the water line and green flagellates in the RBC system, both groups having highest abundances in summer and spring, respectively. Identification of ciliated protozoa populations rendered 58 species of ciliates in the plant. Most of these species are typical of aerobic wastewater treatment systems except three of them, which are cited for the first time in this type of ecosystems: Chaenea stricta, Holosticha mancoidea and Oxytricha lanceolata. Along the water line 34 species were identified, and half of them only appeared occasionally (once in all the study), while along the RBC system biofilms 55 species were observed, and the majority appeared permanently in this system. Our results indicate that the type of habitat, rather than the physico-chemical water parameters, was the primary factor in determining the different distribution of protozoan and metazoan communities in the plant. In RBC biofilms, the structure of ciliate protozoa community was found to be quite sensitive to changes in physico-chemical parameters, mainly to organic loading (BOD5) variations.\n",

      " \n",
      "The significant challenges presented by the April 20, 2010 explosion, sinking, and subsequent oil spill of the Deepwater Horizon drilling platform in Canyon Block 252 about 52 miles southeast of Venice, LA, USA greatly impacted Louisiana’s coastal ecosystem including the sea food industry, recreational fishing, and tourism. The short-term and long-term impact of this oil spill are significant, and the Deepwater Horizon spill is potentially both an economic and an ecological disaster. Microbes present in the water column and sediments have the potential to degrade the oil. Oil degradation could be enhanced by biostimulation method. The conventional approach to bioremediation of petroleum hydrocarbon is based on aerobic processes. Anaerobic bioremediation has been tested only in a very few cases and is still considered experimental. The currently practiced conventional in situ biorestoration of petroleum-contaminated soils and ground water relies on the supply of oxygen to the subsurface to enhance natural aerobic processes to remediate the contaminants. However, anaerobic microbial processes can be significant in oxygen-depleted subsurface environments and sediments that are contaminated with petroleum-based compounds such as oil-impacted marshes in Louisiana. The goal of this work was to identify the right conditions for the indigenous anaerobic bacteria present in the contaminated sites to enhance degradation of petroleum hydrocarbons. We evaluated the ability of microorganisms under a variety of electron acceptor conditions to degrade petroleum hydrocarbons. Researched microbial systems include sulfate-, nitrate-reducing bacteria, and fermenting bacteria. The results indicated that anaerobic bacteria are viable candidates for bioremediation. Enhanced biodegradation was attained under mixed electron acceptor conditions, where various electron-accepting anaerobes coexisted and aided in degrading complex petroleum hydrocarbon components of marsh sediments in the coastal Louisiana. Significant degradation of oil also occurred under sulfate-reducing and nitrate-reducing conditions.\n",

      " \n",
      "OBJECTIVE: In most cases of pediatric liver transplantation, the clinical scenario of large-for-size transplants can lead to hepatic dysfunction and a decreased blood supply to the liver graft. The objective of the present experimental investigation was to evaluate the effects of ischemic preconditioning on this clinical entity. METHODS: Eighteen pigs were divided into three groups and underwent liver transplantation: a control group, in which the weights of the donors were similar to those of the recipients, a large-for-size group, and a large-for-size + ischemic preconditioning group. Blood samples were collected from the recipients to evaluate the pH and the sodium, potassium, aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase levels. In addition, hepatic tissue was sampled from the recipients for histological evaluation, immunohistochemical analyses to detect hepatocyte apoptosis and proliferation and molecular analyses to evaluate the gene expression of Bax (pro-apoptotic), Bcl-XL (anti-apoptotic), c-Fos and c-Jun (immediate-early genes), ischemia-reperfusion-related inflammatory cytokines (IL-1, TNF-alpha and IL-6, which is also a stimulator of hepatocyte regeneration), intracellular adhesion molecule, endothelial nitric oxide synthase (a mediator of the protective effect of ischemic preconditioning) and TGF-beta (a pro-fibrogenic cytokine). RESULTS: All animals developed acidosis. At 1 hour and 3 hours after reperfusion, the animals in the large-for-size and large-for-size + ischemic preconditioning groups had decreased serum levels of Na and increased serum levels of K and aspartate aminotransferase compared with the control group. The molecular analysis revealed higher expression of the Bax, TNF-alpha, I-CAM and TGF-beta genes in the large-for-size group compared with the control and large-for-size + ischemic preconditioning groups. Ischemic preconditioning was responsible for an increase in c-Fos, IL-1, IL-6 and e-NOS gene expression. CONCLUSION: Ischemia-reperfusion injury in this model of large-for-size liver transplantation could be partially attenuated by ischemic preconditioning.\n",

      "10.1371/journal.pone.0003777\n",
      " \n",
      "BACKGROUND: Paper pulp wastewater resulting from alkaline extraction of wheat straw, known as black liquor, is very difficult to be treated and causes serious environmental problems due to its high pH value and chemical oxygen demand (COD) pollution load. Lignin, semicellulose and cellulose are the main contributors to the high COD values in black liquor. Very few microorganisms can survive in such harsh environments of the alkaline wheat straw black liquor. A naturally developed microbial community was found accidentally in a black liquor storing pool in a paper pulp mill of China. The community was effective in pH decreasing, color and COD removing from the high alkaline and high COD black liquor. FINDINGS: Thirty-eight strains of bacteria were isolated from the black liquor storing pool, and were grouped as eleven operational taxonomy units (OTUs) using random amplified polymorphic DNA-PCR profiles (RAPD). Eleven representative strains of each OTU, which were identified as genera of Halomonas and Bacillus, were used to construct a consortium to treat black liquor with a high pH value of 11.0 and very high COD pollution load of 142,600 mg l(-1). After treatment by the constructed consortium, about 35.4% of color and 39,000 mg l(-1) (27.3%) COD(cr) were removed and the pH decreased to 7.8. 16S rRNA gene polymerase chain reaction denaturant gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) analysis suggested a two-stage treatment mechanism to elucidate the interspecies collaboration: Halomonas isolates were important in the first stage to produce organic acids that contributed to the pH decline, while Bacillus isolates were involved in the degradation of lignin derivatives in the second stage under lower pH conditions. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Tolerance to the high alkaline environment and good controllability of the simple consortium suggested that the constructed consortium has good potential for black liquor treatment. Facilitating the treatment process by the constructed consortium would provide a promising opportunity to reduce the pollution, as well as to save forest resources and add value to a waste product.\n",

      " \n",
      "It has long been known that pyruvate is essential for survival of prenatal neurons in culture. To understand the role of exogenous pyruvate in neuronal calcium homeostasis, we have investigated the effects of pyruvate (plus malate) addition to dissociated adult rat hippocampal and cerebral cortex cells and cultured CNS neurons having an unrestricted glucose supply. We found that pyruvate (plus malate) increased the respiration rate while ATP levels were unchanged. At the same time, cytosolic free calcium concentrations, [Ca2+]i, decreased while total 45Ca2+ and 40Ca2+ accumulation increased. The extra Ca2+ accumulated by the cells is attributable to an increase in the size of the intracellular calcium pools. Two such pools were identified on the basis of their sensitivity to specific drugs. The first pool was mobilized by thapsigargin plus tert-butyl hydroquinone and caffeine while the second pool was discharged by the mitochondrial uncoupler carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxphenylhydrazone (FCCP) (plus oligomycin). The two pools represented about 15-20% and 15-30%, respectively, of the rapidly exchangeable 45Ca2+ pools in cerebral cortex cells. In cultured hippocampal neurons, the collapse of the mitochondrial membrane potential (as induced by uncouplers (FCCP) or respiratory chain inhibitors (antimycin) caused a large increase in [Ca2+]i which varied in size and shape among cells and was reduced by external Ca2+ chelation. The latter condition also resulted in a partial discharge of FCCP-releasable 45Ca2+. The effects of FCCP did not result simply from ATP depletion since incubation in glucose-free medium and sequential additions of 2 mM deoxyglucose and 10 microM oligomycin, conditions that led to a dramatic reduction in cellular ATP levels, did not abolish the FCCP-induced [Ca2+]i rise. Taken together, the results indicate that mitochondria harbor a significant proportion of cellular Ca2+. The sensitivity of the mitochondrial pool size to pyruvate (plus malate) questions previous hypotheses concerning a kinetic limitation for Ca2+ accumulation in mitochondria in resting neurons.\n",

      "The coenzyme function of ubiquinone was subject of extensive studies in mitochondria since more than 40 years. The catalytic activity of ubiquinone (UQ) in electron transfer and proton translocation in cooperation with mitochondrial dehydrogenases and cytochromes contributes essentially to the bioenergetic activity of ATP synthesis. In the past two decades UQ was recognized to exert activities which differ from coenzyme functions in mitochondria. From extraction/reincorporation experiments B. Chance has drawn the conclusion that redox-cycling of mitochondrial ubiquinone supplies electrons for univalent reduction of dioxygen. The likelihood of O2(.-) release as normal byproduct of respiration was based on the existence of mitochondrial SOD and the fact that mitochondrial oxygen turnover accounts for more than 90% of total cellular oxygen consumption. Arguments disproving this concept are based on results obtained from a novel noninvasive, more sensitive detection method of activated oxygen species and novel experimental approaches, which threw light into the underlying mechanism of UQ-mediated oxygen activation. Single electrons for O2(.-) formation are exclusively provided by deprotonated ubisemiquinones. Impediment of redox-interaction with the bc1 complex in mitochondria or the lack of stabilizing interactions with redox-partners are promotors of autoxidation. The latter accounts for autoxidation of antioxidant-derived ubisemiquinones in biomembranes, which do not recycle oxidized ubiquinols. Also O2(.-)-derived H2O2 was found to interact with ubisemiquinones both in mitochondria and nonrecycling biomembranes when ubiquinol was active as antioxidant. The catalysis of reductive homolytic cleavage of H2O2, which contributes to HO. formation in biological systems was confirmed under defined chemical conditions in a homogenous reduction system. Apart from dioxygen and hydrogen peroxide we will provide evidence that also nitrite may chemically interact with the ubiquinol/bc1 redox couple in mitochondria. The reaction product NO was reported elsewhere to be a significant bioregulator of the mitochondrial respiration and O2 activation. Another novel finding documents the bioenergetic role of UQ in lysosomal proton intransport. A lysosomal chain of redox couples will be presented, which includes UQ and which requires oxygen as the terminal electron acceptor.\n",

      " \n",
      "The present study investigated the digestion and cholesterol-lowering effects of the water-soluble NSP guar gum (GG) and sodium alginate (SA) in laboratory animals. Groups of five male Wistar strain rats were fed semi-purified cholesterol-free diets containing 0, 50 or 100 g NSP source/kg for 21 d which comprised a 14-d adaptation period followed by a 7-d balance period. Weight gain over the balance period and food conversion ratio decreased linearly with increasing NSP intake ( and respectively). DM digestibility decreased with increasing NSP intake and this effect was greater for SA-containing diets compared with GG-containing diets At the lower inclusion rate, 0.9-1.0 of the additional NSP was digested, but this value fell to 0.8 for both NSP sources at the 100 g/kg inclusion rate, implying that the capacity for near complete digestion of the test NSP had been exceeded. Intestinal tissue mass was increased in response to inclusion of both NSP sources. Caecal digesta pH decreased linearly with additional GG, but increased slightly with consumption of SA. Total caecal short-chain fatty acid concentrations (micromol/g caecal contents) increased markedly with 50 g GG/kg but did not increase further with 100 g GG/kg, and were slightly lower than control values in rats consuming SA. Plasma cholesterol concentration fell linearly with increasing NSP in the diet and the effect was similar for both GG and SA. Total output of faecal bile acids rose in rats fed 50 g GG/kg and 50 g SA/kg (59 micromol/7 d v. 24 micromol/7 d for control rats) with no further increase at the higher inclusion rate. These results show that SA has a strong hypocholesterolaemic effect in rats which is similar to that of GG, and that this effect is most likely to be mediated through an interruption in the entero-hepatic circulation of bile acids and not through increased hepatic supply of propionate from fermentation of the NSP in the large bowel.\n",

      " \n",
      "BackgroundBioelectrochemical systems have been considered a promising novel technology that shows an enhanced energy recovery, as well as generation of value-added products. A number of recent studies suggested that an enhancement of carbon conversion and biogas production can be achieved in an integrated system of microbial electrolysis cell (MEC) and anaerobic digestion (AD) for waste activated sludge (WAS). Microbial communities in integrated system would build a thorough energetic and metabolic interaction network regarding fermentation communities and electrode respiring communities. The characterization of integrated community structure and community shifts is not well understood, however, it starts to attract interest of scientists and engineers.ResultsIn the present work, energy recovery and WAS conversion are comprehensively affected by typical pretreated biosolid characteristics. We investigated the interaction of fermentation communities and electrode respiring communities in an integrated system of WAS fermentation and MEC for hydrogen recovery. A high energy recovery was achieved in the MECs feeding WAS fermentation liquid through alkaline pretreatment. Some anaerobes belonging to Firmicutes (Acetoanaerobium, Acetobacterium, and Fusibacter) showed synergistic relationship with exoelectrogens in the degradation of complex organic matter or recycling of MEC products (H2). High protein and polysaccharide but low fatty acid content led to the dominance of Proteiniclasticum and Parabacteroides, which showed a delayed contribution to the extracellular electron transport leading to a slow cascade utilization of WAS.ConclusionsEfficient pretreatment could supply more short-chain fatty acids and higher conductivities in the fermentative liquid, which facilitated mass transfer in anodic biofilm. The overall performance of WAS cascade utilization was substantially related to the microbial community structures, which in turn depended on the initial pretreatment to enhance WAS fermentation. It is worth noting that species in AD and MEC communities are able to build complex networks of interaction, which have not been sufficiently studied so far. It is therefore important to understand how choosing operational parameters can influence reactor performances. The current study highlights the interaction of fermentative bacteria and exoelectrogens in the integrated system.\n",

      "OBJECTIVE: To investigate risk factors for Acanthamoeba keratitis amongst contact lens wearers in Scotland. DESIGN: Patients with Acanthamoeba keratitis in the Scottish study, all of whom wore contact lenses, were compared with 46 healthy asymptomatic contact lens-wearing controls. They were all visited at home for contact lens and environmental microbiological sampling. In addition, all 288 optical practices in the West of Scotland were polled for contact lens types and disinfecting solutions sold in 1995, and a sample, each of whom fitted more than 500 contact lenses per year, were polled for a second time. Independently, a poll was commissioned by the Eyecare Information Service in July/August 1995 to estimate the numbers of contact lens wearers in Scotland and the UK. Industry was polled for numbers of each contact lens disinfecting regimen sold in Scotland in 1995. SETTING: West of Scotland, UK. SUBJECTS: All contact lens wearers among the 3 million population of the West of Scotland Health Board Areas. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Risk factors for Acanthamoeba infection and recommendations for its prevention. RESULTS: When Acanthamoeba infection occurred, patients' home water systems were frequently (54%) found to be colonised by this amoeba. Patients more frequently washed their storage cases in tap water than controls (P<0.05) with resulting contamination, kept storage cases wet rather than air drying them (P<0.05), and had coliform bacteria cultured from the storage case (P<0.05) and had viable Acanthamoeba within the storage case (P<0.0001). Overall, patients were found to have significantly more risk factors than controls (P<0.0001). The noncompliant use of chlorine tablet disinfection, or failure to disinfect contact lenses at all, was associated with increased risk (P<0.05). Ionic high water content contact lenses (FDA group 4 material), when used without disinfection or with non-compliant use of low chlorine (Soflab) tablet-based disinfection, were associated with increased risk of Acanthamoeba infection (P<0.05). In log-linear modelling of risky hygiene behaviours associated with contamination of storage cases with Acanthamoeba, the most significant behaviour was found to be use of the less effective disinfection methods (chlorine tablets or no disinfection). However further investigation showed that these methods were associated with an increased probability of rinsing the storage case in tap water, so that these two behaviours are confounded in the group studied. CONCLUSIONS: Failure to disinfect contact lenses, non-compliant use of chlorine tablets and/or introduction of tap water rinsing of storage cases were associated with increased risk of Acanthamoeba infection. New multipurpose solutions and hydrogen peroxide gave the lowest risk of Acanthamoeba infection, with no statistically significant difference between them. Ionic high-water content (FDA group 4) contact lenses were at increased risk of being associated with Acanthamoeba keratitis if used without effective disinfection (multipurpose solutions or hydrogen peroxide). The use of domestic tap water for contact lens and storage case hygiene must be avoided, as a chain-of-causation' was identified from the home water supply.\n",

      "10.1113/jp276332\n",
      " \n",
      "KEY POINTS: The ClC-3 2Cl- /1H+ exchanger modulates endosome pH and Cl- concentration. We investigated the relationships between ClC-3-mediated ion transport (steady-state transport current, ISS ), gating charge (Q) and cytoplasmic alkalization. ClC-3 transport is functionally unidirectional. ClC-5 and ClC-3 display indistinguishable exchange ratios, but ClC-3 cycling is less \"efficient\", as reflected by a large Q/ISS . An M531A mutation predicted to increase water-wire stability and cytoplasmic proton supply improves efficiency. Protonation (pH 5.0) of the outer glutamate gate (Gluext ; E224) reduces Q, inhibits transport, and weakens coupling. Removal of the central tyrosine anion gate (Y572S) greatly increases uncoupled anion current. Tyrosine -OH removal (Y572F) alters anion selectivity and impairs coupling. E224 and Y572 act as anion barriers, and contribute to gating. The Y572 side chain and -OH regulate Q movement kinetics and voltage dependence. E224 and Y572 interact to create a \"closed\" inner gate conformation that maintains coupling during cycling. ABSTRACT: We utilized plasma membrane-localized ClC-3 to investigate relationships between steady-state transport current (ISS ), gating charge (Q) movement, and cytoplasmic alkalization rate. ClC-3 exhibited lower transport efficiency than ClC-5, as reflected by a larger Q/ISS ratio, but an indistinguishable Cl- /H+ coupling ratio. External SCN- reduced H+ transport rate and uncoupled anion/H+ exchange by 80-90%. Removal of the external gating glutamate (\"Gluext \") (E224A mutation) reduced Q and abolished H+ transport. We hypothesized that Methionine 531 (M531) impedes \"water wire\" H+ transfer from the cytoplasm to E224. Accordingly, an M531A mutation decreased the Q/ISS ratio by 50% and enhanced H+ transport. External protons (pH 5.0) inhibited ISS and markedly reduced Q while shifting the Q-voltage (V) relationship positively. The Cl- /H+ coupling ratio at pH 5.0 was significantly increased, consistent with externally protonated Gluext adopting an outward/open position. Internal \"anion gate\" removal (Y572S) dramatically increased ISS and impaired coupling, without slowing H+ transport rate. Loss of both gates (Y572S/E224A) resulted in a large \"open pore\" conductance. Y572F (removing only the phenolic hydroxide) and Y572S shortened Q duration similarly, resulting in faster Q kinetics at all voltages. These data reveal a complex relationship between Q and ion transport. Q/ISS must be assessed together with coupling ratio to properly interpret efficiency. Coupling and transport rate are influenced by the anion, internal proton supply and external protons. Y572 regulates H+ coupling as well as anion selectivity, and interacts directly with E224. Disruption of this \"closed gate\" conformation by internal protons may represent a critical step in the ClC-3 transport cycle.\n",

      "An outstanding parameter in cheese making is the type of coagulant, which greatly influences the characteristics of the final products. Proteolysis is the most important set of biochemical changes during ripening of most cheeses, and is carried out, in different magnitude, by proteolytic agents originated in milk, rennet (or rennet substitute), and starter and non-starter micro-organisms (Silva & Malcata, 2000). The demand for alternative sources of milk coagulants, to replace the expensive and limited natural rennet supplies, has increased (Esteves et al. 2001). All commercial enzymes employed as milk coagulant are aspartic proteinases, which are most active at acidic pH and preferentially cleave peptide bonds between residues with hydrophobic side-chains (Silva & Malcata, 1999). Because of the presence of aspartic proteinases, aqueous crude extracts from flowers of Cynara cardunculus (Veríssimo et al. 1995, 1996), Cynara humilis, and/or Cynara scolymus are traditionally employed in the Iberian Peninsula as vegetable rennet for cheesemaking (Reis et al. 2000). Milk clotting activity was also proved in flowers of Centaurea calcitrapa and Onopordum turcicum (Tamer, 1993; Domingos et al. 1998). All these species are included within the Asteraceae family and furthermore in the same tribe: Cardueae Cass.= Cynareae Less. (Ariza Espinar & Delucchi, 1998). When a potential rennet substitute is studied, it is particularly important to evaluate adequately the degradation patterns of the caseins because of their effects on yield, consistency, and flavour of the final cheese (Fox, 1989). It is important to guarantee a well-balanced breakdown of curd proteins (caseins) in order to avoid formation of undesired attributes in cheese such as low viscosity and high bitterness (Visser, 1993). One of the most frequently used methods to monitor proteolytic processes on caseins is urea-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. On the other hand, tricine-SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis improves the separation, identification and quantification of casein hydrolysates because it allows the visualization of large and small peptides (Pardo & Natalucci, 2001), with the additional advantage of allowing the estimation of molecular masses. Both methods are then suitable to characterize the performance of vegetable rennet in different ways. This preliminary study had the following objectives: the partial characterization of (i) the aspartic proteolytic activity present in flowers of Silybum marianum (L.) Gaertn. (Asteraceae); and (ii) the hydrolytic profile of bovine caseins.\n",

      " \n",
      "The rat liver glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase [EC 1.1.1.49] activity was increased on re-feeding animals after two days of fasting. The extent of the increment in the enzyme activity was inversely related to the fat content of the diet. Dietary experiments indicated that unsaturated fatty acids were more effective than saturated fatty acids in suppressing the enzyme induction. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase purified from rat liver was inhibited by the free fatty acids, myristic, lauric and palmitic acids in decreasing order. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase was specifically protected from the inhibition by free fatty acids in the presence of NADP, and, to a lesser extent, in the presence of glucose 6-phosphate. ATP, GTP and ITP facilitated the inhibitory effect of fatty acids, and the effect of ATP was abolished by ADP or AMP. The facilitatory effect of ATP was more significant at high pH values. The transition temperature of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase was markedly lowered by free fatty acids or ATP and elevated by NADP. Free fatty acid disaggregated the active enzyme into inactive subunits. The inhibition of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase in vivo by free fatty acids was discussed and it was suggested that the fatty acid synthesis was controlled in two ways by free fatty acids: one by inhibiting acetyl-CoA carboxylase [EC 6.4.1.2], and the other by restricting the supply of NADPH through the inhibition of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase.\n",

      " \n",
      "The plant cell wall polysaccharide arabinan provides an important supply of arabinose, and unraveling arabinan-degrading strategies by microbes is important for understanding its use as a source of energy. Here, we explored the arabinan-degrading enzymes in the thermophilic bacterium Caldanaerobius polysaccharolyticus and identified a gene cluster encoding two glycoside hydrolase (GH) family 51 α-l-arabinofuranosidases (CpAbf51A, CpAbf51B), a GH43 endoarabinanase (CpAbn43A), a GH27 β-l-arabinopyranosidase (CpAbp27A), and two GH127 β-l-arabinofuranosidases (CpAbf127A, CpAbf127B). The genes were expressed as recombinant proteins, and the functions of the purified proteins were determined with para-nitrophenyl (pNP)-linked sugars and naturally occurring pectin structural elements as the substrates. The results demonstrated that CpAbn43A is an endoarabinanase while CpAbf51A and CpAbf51B are α-l-arabinofuranosidases that exhibit diverse substrate specificities, cleaving α-1,2, α-1,3, and α-1,5 linkages of purified arabinan-oligosaccharides. Furthermore, both CpAbf127A and CpAbf127B cleaved β-arabinofuranose residues in complex arabinan side chains, thus providing evidence of the function of this family of enzymes on such polysaccharides. The optimal temperatures of the enzymes ranged between 60°C and 75°C, and CpAbf43A and CpAbf51A worked synergistically to release arabinose from branched and debranched arabinan. Furthermore, the hydrolytic activity on branched arabinan oligosaccharides and degradation of pectic substrates by the endoarabinanase and l-arabinofuranosidases suggested a microbe equipped with diverse activities to degrade complex arabinan in the environment. Based on our functional analyses of the genes in the arabinan degradation cluster and the substrate-binding studies on a component of the cognate transporter system, we propose a model for arabinan degradation and transport by C. polysaccharolyticusIMPORTANCE Genomic DNA sequencing and bioinformatic analysis allowed the identification of a gene cluster encoding several proteins predicted to function in arabinan degradation and transport in C. polysaccharolyticus The analysis of the recombinant proteins yielded detailed insights into the putative arabinan metabolism of this thermophilic bacterium. The use of various branched arabinan oligosaccharides provided a detailed understanding of the substrate specificities of the enzymes and allowed assignment of two new GH127 polypeptides as β-l-arabinofuranosidases able to degrade pectic substrates, thus expanding our knowledge of this rare group of glycoside hydrolases. In addition, the enzymes showed synergistic effects for the degradation of arabinans at elevated temperatures. The enzymes characterized from the gene cluster are, therefore, of utility for arabinose production in both the biofuel and food industries.\n",

      " \n",
      "Feeding high-concentrate diets has the potential to cause milk fat depression, but several studies have suggested that dietary sugar can increase milk fat yield. Two experiments were conducted to evaluate the ability of dietary molasses to prevent milk fat depression in the presence of a 65% concentrate diet. In trial 1, molasses replaced corn grain at 0, 2.5, or 5% of diet dry matter in diets fed to 12 second-lactation Holstein cows (134±37 d in milk) in a 3×3 Latin square design. Trial 1 demonstrated that replacing up to 5% of dietary dry matter from corn with molasses had positive effects on de novo fatty acid synthesis, increasing the yield of short- and medium-chain fatty acids during diet-induced milk fat depression. Increasing inclusion rate of molasses increased milk fat concentration, but decreased milk yield and milk protein yield. Trial 2 used 7 ruminally cannulated, multiparous, late-lactation Holstein cows (220±18 d in milk) to evaluate effects of dietary molasses on ruminal parameters and milk composition, and also to assess whether increased metabolizable protein supply would alter these responses. Cows were randomly assigned to a dietary treatment sequence in a crossover split plot design with 0 and 5% molasses diets. Dietary treatments were fed for 28 d, with 16 d for diet adaptation, and the final 12 d for 2 abomasal infusion periods in a crossover arrangement. Abomasal infusions of water or AA (5 g of l-Met/d+15 g of l-Lys-HCl/d+5 g of l-His-HCl-H(2)O/d) were administered 3 times daily for 5 d, with 2 d between infusion periods. Administration of AA had no effect on concentration or yield of any milk components. Addition of molasses increased milk fat concentration (2.71 vs. 2.94±0.21%), but had no effect on yields of milk fat or protein. Dietary molasses decreased total volatile fatty acid concentration (141 vs. 133±4.6mM), decreased the molar proportion of propionate, and increased the molar proportion of butyrate in ruminal fluid. Molasses also increased ruminal pH (5.73 vs. 5.87±0.06), decreased the yield of trans-10 C18:1, and increased the yield of trans-11 C18:1 in milk fat. These data provide evidence that molasses may promote mammary de novo fatty acid synthesis in cows fed high-energy rations by moderating ruminal pH and altering ruminal fatty acid biohydrogenation pathways.\n",

      "Recent data indicate positive effects of treating grain with citric (CAc) or lactic acid (LAc) on the hydrolysis of phytate phosphorus (P) and fermentation products of the grain. This study used a semicontinuous rumen simulation technique to evaluate the effects of processing of barley with 50.25 g/L (wt/vol) CAc or 76.25 g/L LAc on microbial composition, metabolic fermentation profile, and nutrient degradation at low or high dietary P supply. The low P diet [3.1g of P per kg of dry matter (DM) of dietary P sources only] was not supplemented with inorganic P, whereas the high P diet was supplemented with 0.5 g of inorganic P per kg of DM through mineral premix and 870 mg of inorganic P/d per incubation fermenter via artificial saliva. Target microbes were determined using quantitative PCR. Data showed depression of total bacteria but not of total protozoa or short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) concentration with the low P diet. In addition, the low P diet lowered the relative abundance of Ruminococcus albus and decreased neutral detergent fiber (NDF) degradation and acetate proportion, but increased the abundance of several predominantly noncellulolytic bacterial species and anaerobic fungi. Treatment of grain with LAc increased the abundance of total bacteria in the low P diet only, and this effect was associated with a greater concentration of SCFA in the ruminal fluid. Interestingly, in the low P diet, CAc treatment of barley increased the most prevalent bacterial group, the genus Prevotella, in ruminal fluid and increased NDF degradation to the same extent as did inorganic P supplementation in the high P diet. Treatment with either CAc or LAc lowered the abundance of Megasphaera elsdenii but only in the low P diet. On the other hand, CAc treatment increased the proportion of acetate in the low P diet, whereas LAc treatment decreased this variable at both dietary P levels. The propionate proportion was significantly increased by LAc at both P levels, whereas butyrate increased only with the low P diet. Treatments with CAc or LAc reduced the degradation of CP and ammonia concentration compared with the control diet at both P levels. In conclusion, the beneficial effects of CAc and LAc treatment on specific ruminal microbes, fermentation profile, and fiber degradation in the low P diet suggest the potential for the treatment to compensate for the lack of inorganic P supplementation in vitro. Further research is warranted to determine the extent to which the treatment can alleviate the shortage of inorganic P supplementation under in vivo conditions.\n",

      " \n",
      "A surgical approach to the cetacean (Tursiops truncatus and Lagenorhynchus obliquidens) ear represented a unique problem. The first obstacle was the development of a safe and humane anesthesia procedure and techniques of long-term physiological maintenance of the animal during surgery. The surgical anatomy was a challenge especially because of the extensive venous plexuses that invest the entire ear and adnexa. The corpus cavernosum carotidis and other small arterial networks course through this venous mass. Sodium pentothal-halothane anesthesia and careful physiological monitoring were determined to be adequate for long-term maintenance during surgery and cochlear recording experiments. A specially designed surgical tank held the animal during the procedure. Immersion in water relieved the lungs of external pressure that ordinarily occurs, when the animal is out of the water, due to the flexible thorax. Thermoregulation was provided for by regulating the water temperature in response to the dolphin's core temperature. This arrangement also provided for underwater auditory stimulation and easy manipulation of the animal since dolphins with their lungs inflated are close to neutral buoyancy. It was necessary to ligate the external and internal carotid arteries, neither of which supplies blood to the ear or brain. Hemostasis in the massive venous plexus could be achieved only by partial removal and subsquent application of oxycel and surgical cement to effectively dam off the area of the round window and other ear structures for electrical potential recording and experimental manipulations. With this technique the round window of the cochlea was exposed. Fully anesthetized animals were maintained for periods up to 24 hours while electrophysiological measurements were being made. Some of the auditory measurements required further surgical manipulation of the auditory meatus, bulla, ossicular chain and other middle-ear structures.\n",

      "Hydrogen is a potential energy carrier for renewable energy as it has a clean emission when consumed. To implement hydrogen energy system in large-scale, a comprehensive hydrogen supply network should be built to supply the required hydrogen with optimal infrastructure arrangement. Although the optimization of hydrogen gas supply chain has been extensively studied, the investigation into an integrated hydrogen-electricity supply chain is still lacking. Considering the interconvertibility of hydrogen and electricity, this study presents a spatial optimization framework that integrates geographical information with mathematical modeling for the design and optimization of a photovoltaic-based hydrogen-electricity supply chain. The proposed framework allows the concurrent targeting of vehicle fuel and electricity demands as well as the identification of suitable locations for supply chain infrastructures. The case study results show that the minimum cost of hydrogen-electricity supply chain is about 14.9 billion USD/y assuming two days of autonomy, and the cost of battery constitutes 43% of the total supply chain cost. When the days of autonomy is 8 and above, hydrogen storage is preferred and electricity is regenerated from hydrogen using fuel cell.Graphical abstract\n",

It could be concluded that the proposed method is feasible and could be popularized to some other cases.\n",

      "During the Expo Shanghai 2010, 196 fuel-cell vehicles (FCVs) were used to transport visitors in and around the Expo Site. To ensure a reliable fuel supply to these FCVs, a well-designed hydrogen supply chain was established, including an industrial by-product hydrogen purification facility, two fixed hydrogen refueling stations and two mobile hydrogen refueling stations. This paper describes the design of this hydrogen supply chain. The experiences, learnings and quantitative findings from the operation of this hydrogen infrastructure are also presented. In general, the hydrogen supply chain performed well in terms of hydrogen quality and the stations availability. The fact that the FCVs were refueled over 20000 times without major incidents can clearly be seen as a success.\n",

      "The integration of hydrogen energy systems in the overall energy system is an important and complex subject for hydrogen supply chain management. The efficiency of the integration depends on finding optimum pathways for hydrogen supply. Accordingly, energy systems modelling methods and tools have been implemented to obtain the best configuration of hydrogen processes for a defined system. The appropriate representation of hydrogen technologies becomes an important stage for energy system modelling activities. This study, split in consecutive parts, has been conducted to analyse how representative hydrogen supply pathways can be integrated in energy systems modelling. The current paper, the first part of a larger study, presents stylised pathways of hydrogen supply chain options, derived on the basis of a detailed literature review. It aims at establishing a reference hydrogen energy system architecture for energy modelling tools. The subsequent papers of the study will discuss the techno-economic assumptions of the hydrogen supply chain components for energy modelling purposes.\n",

      "Hydrogen is a promising energy carrier in the clean energy systems currently being developed. However, its effectiveness in mitigating greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions requires conducting a lifecycle analysis of the process by which hydrogen is produced and supplied. This study focuses on the hydrogen for the transport sector, in particular renewable hydrogen that is produced from wind- or solar PV-powered electrolysis. A life cycle inventory analysis is conducted to evaluate the Well-to-Tank (WtT) GHG emissions from various renewable hydrogen supply chains. The stages of the supply chains include hydrogen being produced overseas, converted into a transportable hydrogen carrier (liquid hydrogen or methylcyclohexane), imported to Japan by sea, distributed to hydrogen filling stations, restored from the hydrogen carrier to hydrogen and filled into fuel cell vehicles. For comparison, an analysis is also carried out with hydrogen produced by steam reforming of natural gas. Foreground data related to the hydrogen supply chains are collected by literature surveys and the Japanese life cycle inventory database is used as the background data. The analysis results indicate that some of renewable hydrogen supply chains using liquid hydrogen exhibited significantly lower WtT GHG emissions than those of a supply chain of hydrogen produced by reforming of natural gas. A significant piece of the work is to consider the impacts of variations in the energy and material inputs by performing a probabilistic uncertainty analysis. This suggests that the production of renewable hydrogen, its liquefaction, the dehydrogenation of methylcyclohexane and the compression of hydrogen at the filling station are the GHG-intensive stages in the target supply chains.\n",

      "Much of the early research in the hydrogen supply chain area was focused on individual technologies of the supply chain, such as production, storage, or distribution, rather than dealing with the supply chain as a whole. The motivation behind this paper is the need to: (1) design a hydrogen supply chain that integrates the previously mentioned components within a single framework, (2) understand the important trade-offs in such a supply chain, and (3) have a full understanding of the data requirements and uncertainties in such an exercise. Optimization techniques were implemented to develop the hydrogen supply chain for the transport sector, therefore, determining the optimum infrastructural and operational costs. Of course, cost is not likely to be the sole determinant of performance in practice. The network of interest was formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem. Also, the network is presented as a steady state ‘snapshot’ problem using Great Britain as a backdrop. The model and assumptions presented in this paper reveal that the optimum future hydrogen supply chain might consist of medium-to-large, centralized methane steam reforming plants. The hydrogen produced from these plants will then be delivered as a liquid via tanker trucks and stored in centralized storage facilities.\n",

      "This study compares the production of hydrogen with high temperature fuel cells (HTFCs) that tri-generate power, heat and hydrogen to distributed and centralized steam methane reformation (SMR) supply chains. The defined supply chain steps of hydrogen production include: production, treatment, distribution, storage, dispensing and use. Different technologies for each step in the supply chain have been analyzed from an energy standpoint, resulting in ten different supply chain scenarios.Results show that liquefaction of hydrogen is the most energy intensive of all the treatment processes and that it is only effective for long delivery distances. When the energy required for the hydrogen treatment (i.e., liquefaction, compression) is included, it is shown that compressed gas hydrogen at 200 bar is the least energy intensive for delivery distances shorter than 84 km if transported by diesel truck. For distances longer than 84 km, 500 bar compressed hydrogen is more efficiently transported than at 200 bar compressed hydrogen. For distances larger than 550 km, liquefied hydrogen is more efficiently distributed than compressed hydrogen at 500 bar.Results show that the highest supply chain efficiency corresponds to distributed hydrogen production via tri-generating HTFC (∼76%) followed by centralized SMR with 500 bar compressed hydrogen distribution (∼71%). The lowest supply chain efficiency values correspond to distributed SMR plants (∼60%) and centralized SMR with transportation of hydrogen in liquid form (<60%).\n",

      "This study investigates the optimal design of low-carbon hydrogen supply chains on a national scale. We consider hydrogen production based on several feedstocks and energy sources, namely water with electricity, natural gas and biomass. When using natural gas, we couple hydrogen production with carbon capture and storage. The design of the hydrogen, biomass and carbon dioxide (CO2) infrastructure is performed by solving an optimization problem that determines the optimal selection, size and location of the hydrogen production technologies, and the optimal structure of the hydrogen, biomass and CO2 networks. First, we investigate the rationale behind the optimal design of low-carbon hydrogen supply chains by referring to an idealized system configuration and by performing a parametric analysis of the most relevant design parameters of the supply chains, such as biomass availability. This allows drawing general conclusions, independent of any specific geographic features, about the minimum-cost and minimum-emissions system designs and network structures. Moreover, we analyze the Swiss case study to derive specific guidelines concerning the design of hydrogen supply chains deploying carbon capture and storage. We assess the impact of relevant design parameters, such as location of CO2 storage facilities, techno-economic features of CO2 capture technologies, and network losses, on the optimal supply chain design and on the competition between the hydrogen and CO2 networks. Findings highlight the fundamental role of biomass (when available) and of carbon capture and storage for decarbonizing hydrogen supply chains while transitioning to a wider deployment of renewable energy sources.\n",

      "As environmental problems become serious, many countries have been striving to change fossil-based energy to renewable and sustainable hydrogen energy. However, there are large capacity differences for each country’s hydrogen production, making hydrogen trading necessary. Although extensive research has investigated hydrogen technologies and economics, to the best of our knowledge, no study has examined the optimization of the overall hydrogen supply chain, from overseas supply to domestic consumption, considering various feasibility scenarios. This is a case study on the hydrogen supply chain for South Korea, which is expected to be one of the major hydrogen-importing countries, considering the decarbonized hydrogen requirements of the importing country and the production capacities of exporting countries over two decades. This study’s optimized results for a hydrogen supply chain via mixed-integer linear programming reveal that it is most feasible for South Korea to import blue hydrogen from Qatar and Russia and green hydrogen from UAE and India, using liquefied hydrogen in the near term. This is because of the significantly lesser resource prices compared to other countries. The share of blue hydrogen supply dominates in the near term, while the green hydrogen supply is expected to gradually prevail over blue hydrogen due to an exponential drop in the renewable electricity price. With the price drop of green hydrogen, green hydrogen purchases from other countries in tandem with the UAE are predicted, rather than the blue hydrogen supply, considering that long-term demand will exceed the UAE’s predicted capacity.\n",

      "This study presents a spatially-resolved optimisation model to assess cost optimal configurations of hydrogen supply chains for the transport sector up to 2050. The model includes hydrogen grades and separation/purification technologies, offering the possibility to assess the effects that hydrogen grades play in the development of cost-effective hydrogen supply chains, including the decisions to repurpose gas distribution networks or blending hydrogen into them. The model is implemented in a case study of Great Britain, for a set of decarbonisation and learning rate scenarios. A base case with a medium carbon price scenario shows that the total discounted cost of the hydrogen supply chain is significantly higher than shown in previous studies, largely due to the additional costs from purification/separation needed to meet hydrogen purity standards for transport applications. Furthermore, it was shown that producing hydrogen from steam methane reforming with carbon capture and storage; installing new transmission pipelines; repurposing the gas distribution network to supply 100% hydrogen; and purifying hydrogen with a pressure swing adsorption system locally at the refuelling station; is a cost optimal configuration for the given technoeconomic assumptions, providing hydrogen at £6.18 per kg at the pump. Purification technologies were found to contribute to 14% and 30% of total discounted investment and operation costs respectively, highlighting the importance of explicitly including them into hydrogen supply chain models for the transport sector.\n",

      "This study involves the construction of a hydrogen supply chain optimization model using a centralized storage model that combines and consolidates flows of hydrogen from different production sites into integrated bulk storage. To supply hydrogen to a fuel cell electric vehicle station, various hydrogen supply pathways and storage configurations for different types of production technologies and transportation modes are considered. In terms of the topological structure, the centralized storage model requires fewer storage areas than the decentralized storage model. The results show that a hydrogen supply chain with a centralized storage structure advances the phase transition of central hydrogen production plants and reduces the total annual cost of the entire supply chain. The optimal hydrogen pathway is on-site steam methane reforming production in the early markets for fuel-cell electric vehicles. However, in matured markets, hydrogen is liquefied in central production plants and stored in bulk storages equipped with vaporizers. Then, the hydrogen is distributed from the central storage areas to local refueling stations via pipelines. The role of central storage areas is predicted to become important as market shares of fuel cell electric vehicle reach 15–30%; in other words, 0.28–0.56 million tonne/year of hydrogen will be demanded in 20 cities of South Korea.\n",

For 2050 case, cost, capacity, and efficiency of facilities are assumed in order to realize the targeted cost 20 JPY/Nm3. The authors set comparable conditions among the carriers, calculated material and energy balances, assumed facilities in three supply chains, and got CAPEX and OPEX of the supply chains. As a result, the authors got two findings. Firstly, among three supply chains, there is small supply cost difference in both 2030 and 2050. Secondly, by comparing the supply costs of each carrier in 2030 and that of 2050, the authors found essential points of research and development; liquefaction, storage and shipping for liquefied hydrogen, composition and decomposition for ammonia, and dehydrogenation for organic hydrides.\n",

      "Overseas hydrogen transport via ships is crucial to meet the global energy supply as we shift from the carbon-based fuel era. In this study, the hydrogen supply chain, which includes chemical and physical storage processes as well as sea and land transport and terminals, was economically and environmentally investigated. Five different storage technologies (i.e., liquid hydrogen, ammonia, toluene-methylcyclohexane [TOL-MCH], dibenzyltoluene-perhydro-dibenzyltoluene (H0DBT-H18DBT), and methanol) were applied to a defined intercontinental hydrogen supply chain that carries 300,000 t of hydrogen per year via ships. The five hydrogen storage technologies were evaluated and compared based on their economic and environmental performance. To achieve a higher energy efficiency, the models were upgraded by integrating liquid natural gas (LNG) to achieve hydrogen liquefaction and utilizing the waste heat of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs). Additionally, assuming that renewable energy capacity will be dominant in the future, renewable electricity and green hydrogen usage were investigated. The results showed that the TOL-MCH supply chain is the most cost-effective and environmentally friendly technology with 5.8 $/kgH2 levelized cost and 18.5 kgCO2-eq/kgH2 carbon intensity, followed by the ammonia supply chain, due to its suitable operating conditions. In the case of renewable electricity and green hydrogen dominance, the ammonia supply chain generates the lowest carbon emissions (i.e., 2.23 kgCO2-eq/kgH2) with a cost of 4.92 $/kgH2, and the TOL-MCH chain is the most cost-effective technology (i.e., 4.57 $/kgH2). Therefore, a decrease in process energy consumption and the use of renewable energy sources are essential for efficient and sustainable hydrogen seaborne transport.\n",

The problem was mathematically represented using a source-sink system approach to determine the most suitable hydrogen supply chain (HSC) network. The optimization problem was formulated as a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model using GAMS® modeling system. The optimization objective consists of the minimization of the total network cost, both in terms of capital and operating expenditures, subject to: supply, demand, mass conservation, technical performance, economic, and environmental constraints.

Given that hydrogen injection into existing natural gas pipeline networks is an economical way to utilise this clean gas, this paper explores its benefits by studying its supply chain optimisation and analysing its reliability. First, a mixed-integer linear programming model is developed to minimise transport and dissatisfaction costs. Material balance, supply and transport of natural gas, operation of pipeline networks, and hydrogen injection are considered as constraints. The operating plans of a regional natural gas supply chain (NGSC), with and without hydrogen injection, are optimised. Then, three types of indicators – economic indices, coal and hydrogen as percentages of total energy consumption, and CO2 emissions – are applied to compare the performance of the NGSC in different situations. A case verifies the proposed model and shows the influence of utilising hydrogen in an NGSC. The optimal operating plans under one standard and two non-standard conditions are calculated, and the reliability of the supply chain is analysed. Results illustrate that injecting hydrogen in the NGSC is beneficial in reducing CO2 emissions and operating costs.\n",

      "Hydrogen mobility is one option for reducing local emissions, avoiding greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and moving away from a mainly oil-based transport system towards a diversification of energy sources. As hydrogen production can be based on a broad variety of technologies already existing or under development, a comprehensive assessment of the different supply chains is necessary regarding not only costs but also diverse environmental impacts. Therefore, in this paper, a broad variety of hydrogen production technologies using different energy sources, renewable and fossil, are exemplarily assessed with the help of a Life Cycle Assessment and a cost assessment for Germany. As environmental impacts, along with the impact category Climate change, five more advanced impact categories are assessed. The results show that from an environmental point of view, PEM and alkaline electrolysis are characterized by the lowest results in five out of six impact categories. Supply chains using fossil fuels, in contrast, have the lowest supply costs; this is true, e.g., for steam methane reforming. Solar powered hydrogen production shows low impacts during hydrogen production but high impacts for transport and distribution to Germany. There is no single supply chain that is the most promising for every aspect assessed here. Either costs have to be lowered further or supply chains with selected environmental impacts have to be modified.\n",

Also, a novel reliability approach is developed to immune the network against disruptions. As a new sustainability indicator, social factors are considered in the design of the hydrogen supply chain.

      "Building a network of hydrogen refuelling stations is essential to develop the hydrogen economy within transport. Additional, hydrogen is regarded a likely key component to store and convert back excess electrical power to secure future energy supply and to improve the quality of biomass-based fuels. Therefore, future hydrogen supply and distribution chains will have to address several objectives. Such a complexity is a challenge for risk assessment and risk management of these chains because of the increasing interactions. Improved methods are needed to assess the supply chain as a whole. The method of “Functional modelling” is discussed in this paper. It will be shown how it could be a basis for other decision support methods for comprehensive risk and sustainability assessments.\n",

      " \n",
      "Hydrogen as a fuel is clean burning, but production can cause substantial greenhouse emissions. Some buyers will prefer to pay a higher price to ensure purchase of low-embedded emissions hydrogen, but it is impossible to determine embedded emissions by examining the end product. Certification of embedded emissions will thus play a key role in the future of hydrogen as a low-emission energy carrier. The boundaries of the supply-chain elements covered in the emissions accounting of certification schemes will have substantial implications for emission-reduction incentives and international tradability. We review the boundary definitions of existing and emerging hydrogen certification schemes. Further, we provide an evidence-based assessment of the magnitude of emissions likely to occur within each boundary of the supply chain. We find varying approaches to boundary definitions in the surveyed schemes. The exclusion of feedstock or transport elements risks ignoring major fractions of supply-chain emissions. In order to balance tradability and emissions-reduction incentives, we recommend that hydrogen certification schemes be designed to follow a modular approach. This type of modular approach would place those with decision-making power over the relevant piece of the supply chain in the position of certifying the emissions within that supply-chain boundary.\n",

      "Hydrogen is central to meeting the challenge of climate change. The lack of infrastructure to produce, store, and deliver hydrogen is a significant obstacle to transitioning toward a hydrogen economy. For two decades, researchers have been interested in modeling the hydrogen supply chain network to provide managerial insights for decision-makers. We contribute to this research domain by introducing the life cycle optimization (LCO) modeling framework into the hydrogen supply chain network design (HSCND). Specifically, the life cycle costing (LCC) methodology and the life cycle assessment (LCA) approach are integrated through a bi-objective optimization. The two objectives are levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH) and global warming potential (GWP) intensity. The problem is solved by implementing an ε-constraint method. The developed LCO framework is applied to a case study in Franche-Comté, France. Results obtained suggest that the introduction of LCC has a major impact on capital costs. The LCA, especially the life cycle inventory (LCI) approach, enables the LCO model to estimate emissions reasonably. The Pareto front obtained by solving the bi-objective model provides a holistic view of turning points. It is concluded that the modeling framework proposed in the paper can provide decision-makers with (i) comprehensive reflection of hydrogen supply network costs; (ii) a detailed description of hydrogen supply chain network-related emissions; and (iii) the quantification and visualization of the trade-off between costs and emissions.\n",

The proposed model considers the feedstock supply, the installation and operation of hydrogen facilities, the operation of transportation technologies, and the carbon capture and storage (CCS) system. Two primary hydrogen fueling technologies, namely on-site fueling (hydrogen is produced on-site) and standard fueling (hydrogen is delivered by road), are considered. The problem is formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model that minimizes the least cost of hydrogen (LCOH). The necessity of considering various components within a single framework is demonstrated through a case study in Franche-Comté, France. The role of each key model component (such as the fueling technology, feedstock transportation, and CCS system) is analyzed. The proposed model is capable of studying the interactions that exist between different parts of a hydrogen supply network.

A practical selecting procedure of adding hydrogen refueling service to existing natural gas (NG) stations is proposed in this study. A case study in Wuhan, China, is established to assess the feasibility and future planning. The demand for hydrogen fuel and initial supply chain of hydrogen in Wuhan are estimated based on the deployment objective of fuel cell buses. The existing NG stations are evaluated based on 300 kg/day to determine whether they meet the hydrogen safety requirement using Google map or field investigation. The safety space requirement of the hydrogen refueling area on existing NG station is determined as 25.9 × 27.1 m2. The optimal hydrogen refueling plan for fuel cell buses is calculated with multi‐objective analysis in economic, environmental, and safety aspects from the view of the hydrogen refueling supply chain. It is shown that adding hydrogen refueling stations to existing NG stations is feasible in technology, economics, regulation, and operation considerations. This study provides guidelines for building the hydrogen infrastructure for fuel cell buses at their early stage of commercial operation.

      "Introducing hydrogen as the fuel of the future necessitates a comprehensive, widespread supply chain network that is capable of producing, distributing, storing, and dispensing hydrogen to end users. Most of the early attempts to design and model the future hydrogen supply chain (HSC) were either limited to examining an individual component of the supply chain or focused on a predetermined hydrogen pathway. In these studies, a simulation-based approach has commonly been adopted rather than using a mathematical programming-based approach. The work presented here is an extension of an early attempt to design and operate a deterministic, steady-state HSC network using a mathematical modelling approach. In this paper, however, the model is developed to consider the availability of energy sources (i.e. raw materials) and their logistics, as well as the variation of hydrogen demand over a long-term planning horizon leading to phased infrastructure development. The proposed model is formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) and solved via a commercial software tool, GAMS. The results show that the optimal design of the future HSC network of Great Britain (GB) starts with small-size plant together with using the hydrogen currently produced by chemical processing plants. As demand grows, more plants of different sizes should be built to meet the demand. The hydrogen produced will be transported using liquid hydrogen trucks and stored in different sizes of storage facilities.\n",

We, therefore, demonstrate experimentally that significant amounts of hydrogen gas can be stored via this route. Hydrogen adsorption capacities reached 0.6 moles H2/kg of coal at 14.3 MPa, and adsorption capacity initially increased strongly with pressure (up to ∼4 MPa) and then plateaued out, while temperature only had a very minor influence.

This study improves current literature by adding supply chain optimization options (cold energy recovery and hydrogen production) and by analyzing the entire supply chain of four different LNG end-users (power generation, industrial heating, residential heating, and truck usage). This resulted in 33 LNG pathways for which the energy efficiency, life cycle GHG emissions, and life cycle costs were determined by process-based material and energy flow analysis, life cycle assessment, and production cost calculation, respectively. The LNG and hydrogen supply chains were compared with a reference chain (coal or diesel) to determine avoided GHG emissions and GHG avoidance costs. Results show that NG with full cryogenic carbon dioxide capture (FCCC) is most beneficial pathway for both avoided GHG emissions and GHG avoidance costs (70.5–112.4 g CO2-e/MJLNG and 66.0–95.9 $/t CO2-e).

Sensitivity analysis reveals that HFCV, HFC and biohydrogen are the three industries that are most sensitive to technology advance.

      "A viable hydrogen infrastructure is one of the main challenges for fuel cells in mobile applications. Several studies have investigated the most cost-efficient hydrogen supply chain structure, with a focus on hydrogen transportation. However, supply chain models based on hydrogen produced by electrolysis require additional seasonal hydrogen storage capacity to close the gap between fluctuation in renewable generation from surplus electricity and fuelling station demand. To address this issue, we developed a model that draws on and extends approaches in the literature with respect to long-term storage. Thus, we analyse Liquid Organic Hydrogen Carriers (LOHC) and show their potential impact on future hydrogen mobility. We demonstrate that LOHC-based pathways are highly promising especially for smaller-scale hydrogen demand and if storage in salt caverns remains uncompetitive, but emit more greenhouse gases (GHG) than other gaseous or hydrogen ones. Liquid hydrogen as a seasonal storage medium offers no advantage compared to LOHC or cavern storage since lower electricity prices for flexible operation cannot balance the investment costs of liquefaction plants. A well-to-wheel analysis indicates that all investigated pathways have less than 30% GHG-emissions compared to conventional fossil fuel pathways within a European framework.\n",

      "Several roadmaps and international projects are interested in the development of the hydrogen economy for the transportation system. Yet, the development of a hydrogen economy suffers from a lack of infrastructure to store and supply H2 fuel to the refuelling stations, while at the same time, hydrogen can be just seen as one alternative among others to compete with the current fossil fuels. To determine if hydrogen is a competitive option, many scenarios must be assessed considering not only the cost as the target to determine the feasibility but, also environmental and safety objectives. This work is focused on the design of a hydrogen supply chain for deployment scenarios in the Midi-Pyrénées region in France based on multi-objective optimization. Specific constraints related to the energy sources have been integrated and a multi-period long-term problem is examined (2020–2050). Two solution strategies will be implemented to solve this multi-period problem: a global optimization through ε-constraint method and a sequential optimization through lexicographic and ε-constraint methods. The consideration of different geographical scales and the impact of the initiation step in the development of a sustainable supply chain have been highlighted.\n",

      "Substitution of petro-based aviation fuel with biomass-derived aviation fuel is an emerging strategy to reduce the carbon footprint associated with the aviation sector. There are several pathways for the production of aviation biofuel, and most of them require the use of hydrogen. Therefore, the analysis of the aviation biofuel supply chain must incorporate the production of hydrogen. This paper presents an optimization approach for the strategic planning of aviation fuel supply chains, which considers hydrogen production from fossil and renewable raw materials. The approach also considers extraction of fossil materials, growth of biomass, selection and several processing routes of the feedstock, along with the distribution of products. As a case study, the strategic planning of aviation biofuels in Mexico considering the generation of biomass and the hydrogen production is selected. The results show that significant decreases in producing costs and CO2 emissions can be obtained if aviation fuel is generated from renewable raw materials. This finding is quite important, because in Mexico 90% of the consumed energy proceed from fossil sources. Several scenarios are addressed to assess the key factors in the design of the supply chain, reconciling the economic and environmental objectives; and also an analysis for the integration of the infrastructures of the fossil fuels and biorefineries is presented.\n",

      "Low-carbon hydrogen is an essential element in the transition to net-zero emissions by 2050. Hydrogen production from biomass is a promising bio-energy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) scheme that could produce low-carbon hydrogen and generate the carbon dioxide removal (CDR) envisioned to be required to offset hard-to-abate emissions. Here, we design a BECCS supply chain for hydrogen production from biomass with carbon capture and storage and quantify, at high spatial resolution, the technical potential for hydrogen production and CDR in Europe. We consider sustainable biomass feedstocks that have minimal impacts on food security and biodiversity, namely agricultural residues and waste. We find that this BECCS supply chain can produce up to 12.5 Mtons of H2 per year (currently ∼10 Mtons of H2 per year are used in Europe) and remove up to 133 Mtons CO2 per year from the atmosphere (or 3% of European total greenhouse gas emissions). We then perform a geospatial analysis to quantify transportation distances between where biomass feedstocks are located and potential hydrogen users, and find that 20% of hydrogen potential is located within 25 km from hard-to-electrify industries. We conclude that BECCS supply chains for hydrogen production from biomass represent an overlooked near-term opportunity to generate carbon dioxide removal and low-carbon hydrogen.\n",

      "The UK is the first major economy to legislate the reduction of all GHG emissions to net-zero. Greenhouse gas removal (GGR) approaches are likely to be required to support the 2050 net-zero target by offsetting residual emissions from ‘hard-to-abate’ sectors. Bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) is investigated as one technical solution for GGR. This research used process modelling and lifecycle assessment to identify the GGR potential of three BECCS supply chains. Results show that the BECCS supply chains have significant GGR potential with net-negative emissions as CO2e between −647 and −1137 kg MWh−1. Emissions were compared per unit energy output, biomass and area required for each supply chain to assess the GGR potential and BECCS sustainability implications. The large-scale BECCS supply chain features robust technologies with high capacity factor. It produces the greatest electricity generation and annual GGR, however, demands large amounts of biomass raising potential sustainability issues. The medium-scale (CHP) BECCS provides the greatest GGR potential per energy due to its higher energy efficiency. Limitations are a low capacity factor, energy demand-supply balance and non-existent decentralised CCS infrastructure. The (hydrogen) BECCS supply chain is more versatile, producing hydrogen with the potential to support the decarbonisation of not just power, but heat and transport sectors. The GGR potential sits in the middle and has greater benefits from a biomass sustainability perspective, yet, hydrogen infrastructure is not established, and costs remain uncertain. The relative performance of alternative BECCS supply chains should consider direct links between CO2 removal and sustainable biomass and land use, as well as GGR potential.\n",

Energy companies are likely to extend interests in hydrogen exports and will need a credible hydrogen supply chain. Patent intensity, coupled with recent hydrogen production technology reviews and commercial activity by companies such as Kawasaki, provides support for forecasting a hydrogen supply chain that will include the following steps: Steam reforming of methane or coal, preferably methane, to produce hydrogen; hydrogen liquefaction (LH2) in preference to ammonia or liquid organic hydrogen carriers (LOHC) such as toluene (though this methodology has been trialled for Brunei produced hydrogen); shipping of LH2 to export markets; hydrogen gasification by end users. Given the 20 year lifecycle of patents, this forecast is anticipated to hold until 2030–40. The forecast does not exclude other technical options for hydrogen production and shipping but cost and technical risk will need to be minimised below the mature technologies of steam reforming and hydrogen liquefaction.\n",

      "Projections of decarbonisation pathways have typically involved reducing dependence on natural gas grids via greater electrification of heat using heat pumps or even electric heaters. However, many technical, economic and consumer barriers to electrification of heat persist. The gas network holds value in relation to flexibility of operation, requiring simpler control and enabling less expensive storage. There may be value in retaining and repurposing gas infrastructure where there are feasible routes to decarbonisation. This study quantifies and analyses the decarbonisation potential associated with the conversion of gas grids to deliver hydrogen, focusing on supply chains. Routes to produce hydrogen for gas grids are categorised as: reforming natural gas with (or without) carbon capture and storage (CCS); gasification of coal with (or without) CCS; gasification of biomass with (or without) CCS; electrolysis using low carbon electricity. The overall range of greenhouse gas emissions across routes is extremely large, from − 371 to 642 gCO2eq/kW hH2. Therefore, when including supply chain emissions, hydrogen can have a range of carbon intensities and cannot be assumed to be low carbon. Emissions estimates for natural gas reforming with CCS lie in the range of 23–150 g/kW hH2, with CCS typically reducing CO2 emissions by 75%. Hydrogen from electrolysis ranges from 24 to 178 gCO2eq/kW hH2 for renewable electricity sources, where wind electricity results in the lowest CO2 emissions. Solar PV electricity typically exhibits higher emissions and varies significantly by geographical region. The emissions from upstream supply chains is a major contributor to total emissions and varies considerably across different routes to hydrogen. Biomass gasification is characterised by very large negative emissions in the supply chain and very large positive emissions in the gasification process. Therefore, improvements in total emissions are large if even small improvements to gasification emissions can be made, either through process efficiency or CCS capture rate.\n",

However, for commercial widespread use and feasibility of hydrogen technology, it is of utmost importance to develop cost-effective and safe technologies for storage and transportation of LH2 for use in stationary applications as well as offshore transportation. This paper reviews various aspects of global hydrogen supply chain starting from several ways of production to storage and delivery to utilization. While each these aspects contribute to the overall success and efficiency of the global supply chain, storage and delivery/transport are the key enablers for establishing global hydrogen technology, especially while current infrastructure and technology are being under development. In addition, while all storage options have their own advantages/disadvantages, the LH2 storage has unique advantages due to the familiarity with well-established LNG technology and existing hydrogen technology in space programs. However, because of extremely low temperature constraints, commercialization of LH2 technology for large-scale storage and transportation faces many challenges, which are discussed in this paper along with the current status and key gaps in the existing technology.\n",

Analyzed supply chain pathways include seasonal storage to balance fluctuating renewable power generation with necessary purification, as well as trailer- and pipeline-based hydrogen delivery. The analysis encompasses green hydrogen feedstock in the chemical industry and fuel cell-based mobility applications, such as local buses, non-electrified regional trains, material handling vehicles, and trucks, as well as passenger cars. Our results indicate that the utilization of low-cost, long-term storage and improved refueling station utilization have the highest impact during the market introduction phase. We find that public transport and captive fleets offer a cost-efficient countrywide renewable hydrogen supply roll-out option. Furthermore, we show that, at comparable effective carbon tax resulting from the current energy tax rates in Germany, hydrogen is cost-competitive in the transportation sector by the year 2025. Moreover, we show that sector-specific CO2 taxes are required to provide a cost-competitive green hydrogen supply in both the transportation and industrial sectors.\n",

The results of the scenario analyses show, among others, that green hydrogen, i.e., water electrolysis-oriented hydrogen production, consumes a fairly large amount of electricity.

The hydrogen demand was determined using two method: Firstly, by assuming that the hydrogen demand in Peninsular Malaysia as a function of total vehicle numbers, average total distance traveled and vehicle fuel economy were measured. While the second method investigated based on the current supply of gasoline and diesel from surveys on local petrol stations in Peninsular Malaysia.

However, there is still no appropriate infrastructure available for its commercialization. This study proposes a methodology for designing a hydrogen supply chain while considering the inherent uncertainty associated with the demand for this fuel in the future. To represent the problem and evaluate investment alternatives for the logistic infrastructure, an optimization model is proposed based on two-stage stochastic mixed-integer programming. To obtain solutions from the proposed model, the sample average approximation (SAA) method is used to obtain statistically certified solutions from a reduced number of scenarios. The proposed methodology was applied to the design of Great Britain's liquid hydrogen supply chain using real data.

      "Hydrogen is fast becoming a new international “super fuel” to accelerate global climate change ambitions. This paper has two inter-weaving themes. Contextually, it focuses on the potential impact of the EU’s new Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) on fossil fuel-generated as opposed to green hydrogen imports. The CBAM, as a transnational carbon adjustment mechanism, has the potential to impact international trade in energy. It seeks both a level playing field between imports and EU internal markets (subject to ambitious EU climate change policies), and to encourage emissions reduction laggards through its “carbon diplomacy”. Countries without a price on carbon will be charged for embodied carbon in their supply chains when they export to the EU. Empirically, we focus on two hydrogen export/import case studies: Australia as a non-EU state with ambitions to export hydrogen, and Germany as an EU Member State reliant on energy imports. Energy security is central to energy trade debates but needs to be conceptualized beyond supply and demand economics to include geopolitics, just transitions and the impacts of border carbon taxes and EU carbon diplomacy. Accordingly, we apply and further develop a seven-dimension energy security-justice framework to the examples of brown, blue and green hydrogen export/import hydrogen operations, with varying carbon-intensity supply chains, in Australia and Germany. Applying the framework, we identify potential impact—risks and opportunities—associated with identified brown, blue and green hydrogen export/import projects in the two countries. This research contributes to the emerging fields of international hydrogen trade, supply chains, and international carbon diplomacy and develops a potentially useful seven-dimension energy security-justice framework for energy researchers and policy analysts.\n",

      "Hydrogen technologies have received increased attention in research and development to foster the shift towards carbon-neutral energy systems. Depending on the specific production techniques, transportation concepts, and application areas, hydrogen supply chains (HSCs) can be anything from part of the energy transition problem to part of the solution: Even more than battery-driven electric mobility, hydrogen is a polyvalent technology and can be used in very different contexts with specific positive or negative sustainability impacts. Thus, a detailed sustainability evaluation is crucial for decision making in the context of hydrogen technology and its diverse application fields. This article provides a comprehensive, structured literature review in the context of HSCs along the triple bottom line dimensions of environmental, economic, and social sustainability, analyzing a total of 288 research papers. As a result, we identify research gaps mostly regarding social sustainability and the supply chain stages of hydrogen distribution and usage. We suggest further research to concentrate on these gaps, thus strengthening our understanding of comprehensive sustainability evaluations for HSCs, especially in social sustainability evaluation. In addition, we provide an additional approach for discussion by adding literature review results from neighboring fields, highlighting the joint challenges and insights regarding sustainability evaluation.\n",

      "Hydrogen is recognized as a key element of future low-carbon energy systems. For proper integration, an adequate delivery infrastructure will be required, to be deployed in parallel to the electric grid and the gas network. This work adopts an optimization model to support the design of a future hydrogen delivery infrastructure, considering production, storage, and transport up to demand points. The model includes two production technologies, i.e., steam reforming with carbon capture and PV-fed electrolysis systems, and three transport modalities, i.e., pipelines, compressed hydrogen trucks, and liquid hydrogen trucks. This study compares a multi-modality formulation, in which the different transport technologies are simultaneously employed and their selection is optimized, with a mono-modality formulation, in which a single transport technology is considered. The assessment looks at the regional case study of Lombardy in Italy, considering a long-term scenario in which an extensive hydrogen supply chain is developed to supply hydrogen for clean mobility. Results show that the multi-modality infrastructure provides significant cost benefits, yielding an average cost of hydrogen that is up to 11% lower than a mono-modality configuration.\n",

      "High penetration of renewable energy brings seasonal electricity imbalance in the power system and results in considerable energy curtailment. Such large-scale curtailed electricity could be used to produce hydrogen via power-to-hydrogen (P2H) technology. The introduction of P2H would largely affect the configuration of both the power grid and hydrogen supply chain (HSC). This article proposes a coordinated planning model of power system generation and transmission (GT) as well as HSC with transportable seasonal hydrogen storage. A coplanning model is put forward to investigate the optimal configuration of infrastructures in the GT-HSC and their coupling during operation. The model is formulated as an LP model so that the year-round energy balance of seasonal hydrogen storage with daily resolution could be considered. Case studies on 5-bus PJM system and Northwest China HRP-38 system demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model. Results of the case study also illustrate the benefits of incorporating GT with HSC to reduce the renewable energy curtailment and bring down the energy supply cost.\n",

      "Hydrogen deployment as an energy vector will play a crucial role in the decarbonization of the energy and industrial sectors. Its integration with the energy system requires the development of an adequate delivery infrastructure. The identification of an optimal design and operation strategy is complex due the variety of technological options in each stage of the hydrogen supply chain. This work develops a mixed-integer linear programming model to optimize the design and operation of a hydrogen infrastructure, comprising the entire supply chain from production to demand. A crucial novelty element is the combination of technical alternatives and modelling features. The proposed multi-modality formulation optimizes the transport technology at each stage, selecting between pipelines, compressed hydrogen trucks, and liquid hydrogen trucks. The pipeline and road networks are built through the model integration with a Geographic Information System, and the operation is tracked with a daily resolution, following the typical day approach. The model application looks at hydrogen employment for clean mobility in a long-term scenario in the Italian region of Sicily, assuming a demand of 1.1 million equivalent passenger cars (30% of today’s stock). The resulting cost-optimal infrastructure features an average cost of delivered hydrogen of 3.81€/kg, in line with mobility targets. The supply chain relies on the concurrent use of all transport modalities, thus showing that the multiplicity of options is a key asset in the development of a hydrogen economy.\n",

We present a holistic study of various options for transporting (not producing) hydrogen from both techno-economic and environmental perspectives. The infrastructure and energy requirements of four options for transporting hydrogen between export and import terminals, namely methyl cyclohexane, liquid hydrogen, compressed hydrogen, and liquid ammonia, are analyzed in detail. These are compared for HSC energy penalty, carbon avoidance and landed cost of hydrogen under different scenarios. A case study is also presented to capture the perspectives of an importer. The preferred transport mode depends on export location and end use. For Singapore's power sector, compressed hydrogen from the neighbors via pipelines is most favorable with a carbon avoidance of 54–59% at 0.3 $/kg CO2 avoided.\n",

The effectivenes of policies aiming to enhance the financial viability of low-carbon hydrogen production was quantified. A spatially explicit, multi-period cost optimization model was developed for light duty hydrogen hydrogen vehicle deployment in British Columbia under three demand scenarios. Subsidies and regulations were coupled to current provincial policies (a carbon tax and a low carbon fuel standard). The results indicated that production tax credits and electricity incentives were up to 24 times more effective in facilitating low-carbon hydrogen production compared to capital subsidies, bans on steam methane reforming or the adoption of higher carbon taxes. The strategic deployment of policies over time was found to be more effective than cumulative subsidies.\n",

      "Hydrogen is an energy carrier that represents a possible clean fuel of the future. This paper assesses the effect of biomass co-firing on gasification based hydrogen production supply chain, with carbon dioxide capture and storage, from technical, economical and environmental point of view. Several cases consisting of various feedstocks to the gasification reactor are investigated (coal only and coal in mixture with sawdust or wheat straw). Considered plant concepts generate between 330 and 460MW hydrogen of 99.99% (vol.) purity.First a performance analysis regarding the energy efficiency of the process, the syngas composition and the carbon dioxide capture rate is carried out. The simulations are made using chemical process simulation software Aspen Plus. Second, total capital investment and operating costs for the gasification plant are evaluated. Finally, using the results from Aspen Plus simulations and the cost estimations, a discrete event model is developed, to address hydrogen production supply chain analysis under demand variability, with Arena software. The implications of biomass co-firing on the system are evaluated in terms of: hydrogen amount sold and hydrogen amount stored (MW), hydrogen lost sales amount (MW), partial sales percent and gasification plant profit.The results show that as the biomass quantity in the feedstock increases the hydrogen production rate decreases by 9–28% for sawdust, respectively by 7–23% for wheat straw. The energy efficiency of the process and the gasification plant profit also decrease, but the CO2 emissions are lower for the cases of biomass co-firing.\n",

To this end, we considered the coupling of multiple biomass hybrid utilization processes for hydrogen production. First, we calculated and evaluated the biomass utilization potential of a given area. Second, we predicted the biomass gasification products using chemical reaction kinetics and thermodynamic models. Finally, we determined the optimal annual total cost of the hydrogen production supply chain by optimizing the microscopic operation of the biomass gasification plant. Through the proposed method, it is possible to effectively conduct a comprehensive assessment of regional biomass material hydrogen production; moreover, the optimal design of the biomass hydrogen production supply chain can also be determined based on the availability of biomass and hydrogen demand. More precisely, the logistics operations under fluctuating demand conditions were realized, enabling strategic decision-making for planning a biomass hydrogen production system. To validate the model, a case study analysis of biomass hydrogen production, to be launched in Sichuan Province, China, is presented.\n",

      "In order to assess the feasibility of utilizing renewable hydrogen as transport fuel for fuel cell vehicles, four possible low-carbon hydrogen supply routes for a hydrogen refueling station located in Shanghai are studied. Route Ⅰ and II are onsite hydrogen supply routes powered by a stand-alone or grid-connected photovoltaic (PV)-wind generation system separately. Route Ⅲ and IV are offsite hydrogen supply routes, in which hydrogen is produced by a stand-alone or grid-connected PV-wind generation system located in Qinghai Province respectively and delivered via liquid hydrogen truck to Shanghai. The microgrid system for hydrogen production is designed and optimized with the aid of HOMER Pro® software. The results show that in hydrogen production stage, Route Ⅳ shows the best economic performance, both in the total net present cost (NPC) cost and levelized cost of energy (LCOE) cost. As for the whole hydrogen supply chain, Route IV is also the most economic hydrogen supply way, the levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH) of which is slightly lower than that of Route II. The sensitivity results show that the total LCOH cost of Route Ⅳ is feasible based on the current shorter electrolyzer's lifetime. Therefore, it indicates that nowadays, producing hydrogen from a grid connected PV-wind hybrid power system in renewable energy rich area (Qinghai Province) and delivering it via liquid hydrogen truck to a refueling station in east coast area (Shanghai) of China may be a feasible solution.\n",

The model was applied to the light duty passenger vehicle sector in British Columbia under three hydrogen demand scenarios. As part of the objective function, the model incorporated the current provincial emissions mitigation policies, i.e., a carbon tax and a low-carbon fuel standard (LCFS). Based on cost, our model indicates that steam methane reforming (SMR) is the least costly hydrogen production technology even with carbon policies in place. However, SMR would result in higher emissions (compared to other pathways). Coupling the carbon tax with the LCFS can be a suitable policy option when hydrogen price and GHG emissions are weighted equally.\n",

      "Diesel fuel combustion results in exhaust containing air pollutants and greenhouse gas emissions. Many railway vehicles use diesel fuel as their energy source. Exhaust emissions, as well as concerns about economical, alternative power supply, have driven efforts to move to hydrogen motive power. Hydrogen fuel cell technology applied to railways offers the opportunity to eliminate harmful exhaust emissions and the potential for a low- or zero-emission energy supply chain. Currently, only multiple-unit trains with hydrail technology operate commercially. Development of an Integrated Hybrid Train Simulator for intercity railway is presented. The proposed tool incorporates the effect of powertrain components during the wheel-to-tank process. Compared to its predecessors, the proposed reconfigurable tool provides high fidelity with medium requirements and minimum computation time. Single train simulation and the federal government’s Greenhouse gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy use in Transportation (GREET®) model are used in combination to evaluate the feasibility of various train and powertrain configurations. The Piedmont intercity service operating in North Carolina is used as a case study. The study includes six train configurations and powertrain options as well as nine hydrogen supply options in addition to the diesel supply. The results show that a hydrail option is not only feasible, but a low- or zero-carbon hydrogen supply chain could be possible.\n",

The network design problem is formulated as a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problem to identify the optimal supply chain configurations from various alternatives. The objective is to consider not only cost efficiency, but also safety. Since there is a trade-off between these two objectives, formal multiobjective optimization techniques are required to establish the optimal Pareto solutions that can then be used for decision-making purposes. With the model, the effects of demand uncertainty can be also analyzed by comparing the deterministic and the stochastic solutions. The features and capabilities of the model are illustrated through the application of future hydrogen infrastructure of Korea. The optimal Pareto solutions utilize both cost-oriented and safety-oriented strategies.\n",

Based on univariate sensitivity analysis, uncertainty in hydrogen demand has a very strong impact on the overall system costs. Therefore we consider a scenario tree for a stochastic mixed integer linear programming model that incorporates the uncertainty in the hydrogen demand. The model consists of two configurations, which are analyzed and compared to each other according to production types: water electrolysis versus steam methane reforming. Each configuration has a cost minimization target. The concept of value of stochastic solution (VSS) is used to evaluate the stochastic optimization results and compare them to their deterministic counterpart. The VSS of each configuration shows significant benefits of a stochastic optimization approach for the model presented in this study, corresponding up to 26% of infrastructure investments savings.\n",

      "Hydrogen can contribute substantially to the reduction of carbon emissions in industry and transportation. However, the production of hydrogen through electrolysis creates interdependencies between hydrogen supply chains and electricity systems. Therefore, as governments worldwide are planning considerable financial subsidies and new regulation to promote hydrogen infrastructure investments in the next years, energy policy research is needed to guide such policies with holistic analyses. In this study, we link an electrolytic hydrogen supply chain model with an electricity system dispatch model. We use this methodology for a cross-sectoral case study of Germany in 2030. We find that hydrogen infrastructure investments and their effects on the electricity system are strongly influenced by electricity prices. Given current uniform single-prices in Germany, hydrogen production increases congestion costs in the electricity grid by 17%. In contrast, passing spatially resolved electricity price signals leads to electrolyzers being placed at low-cost grid nodes and further away from consumption centers. This causes lower end-use costs for hydrogen. Moreover, congestion management costs decrease substantially, by up to 20% compared to the benchmark case without hydrogen. These savings could be transferred into according subsidies for hydrogen production. Thus, our study demonstrates the benefits of differentiating economic signals for hydrogen production based on spatial criteria.\n",

      "This paper is written in response to the paper “How green is blue hydrogen?” by R. W. Howarth and M. Z. Jacobson. It aims at highlighting and discussing the method and assumptions of that paper, and thereby providing a more balanced perspective on blue hydrogen, which is in line with current best available practices and future plant specifications aiming at low CO2 emissions. More specifically, in this paper, we show that: (i) the simplified method that Howarth and Jacobson used to compute the energy balance of blue hydrogen plants leads to significant overestimation of CO2 emissions and natural gas (NG) consumption and (ii) the assumed methane leakage rate is at the high end of the estimated emissions from current NG production in the United States and cannot be considered representative of all‐NG and blue hydrogen value chains globally. By starting from the detailed and rigorously calculated mass and energy balances of two blue hydrogen plants in the literature, we show the impact that methane leakage rate has on the equivalent CO2 emissions of blue hydrogen. On the basis of our analysis, we show that it is possible for blue hydrogen to have significantly lower equivalent CO2 emissions than the direct use of NG, provided that hydrogen production processes and CO2 capture technologies are implemented that ensure a high CO2 capture rate, preferably above 90%, and a low‐emission NG supply chain. This paper is written in response to the paper “How green is blue hydrogen?” by R. W. Howarth and M. Z. Jacobson and aims at highlighting some flaws in the method and assumptions of that paper and at providing a more balanced perspective on blue hydrogen. By starting from the detailed and rigorously calculated mass and energy balances of two blue hydrogen plants in the literature, we show the impact that methane leakage rate has on the equivalent CO2 emissions of blue hydrogen. We conclude that for blue hydrogen to have a role in the transition to a renewable net‐zero economy, it is necessary to: (i) adopt hydrogen production processes and CO2 capture technologies ensuring high CO2 capture rate, possibly above 90%; (ii) develop a low‐emission natural gas supply chain, and (iii) adopt a life cycle approach based on reliable accounting of the methane leakage from the supply chain\n",

      "Hydrogen technologies are promising candidates of new energy technologies for electric power load smoothing. However, regardless of long-term public investment, hydrogen economy has not been realized. In Japan, the National Research and Development Institute of New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO), a public research-funding agency, has invested more than 200 billion yen in the technical development of hydrogen-related technologies. However, hydrogen technologies such as fuel cell vehicles (FCVs) have not been disseminated yet. Continuous and strategic research and development (R&D) are needed, but there is a lack of expertise in this field. In this study, the transition of the budgetary allocations by NEDO were analyzed by classifying NEDO projects along the hydrogen supply chain and research stage. We found a different R&D focus in different periods. From 2004 to 2007, empirical research on fuel cells increased with the majority of research focusing on standardization. From 2008 to 2011, investment in basic research of fuel cells increased again, the research for verification of fuel cells continued, and no allocation for research on hydrogen production was confirmed. Thereafter, the investment trend did not change until around 2013, when practical application of household fuel cells (ENE-FARM) started selling in 2009, in terms of hydrogen supply chain. Hydrogen economy requires a different hydrogen supply infrastructure, that is, an existing infrastructure of city gas for ENE-FARM and a dedicated infrastructure for FCVs (e.g., hydrogen stations). We discussed the possibility that structural inertia could prevent the transition to investing more in hydrogen infrastructure from hydrogen utilization technology. This work has significant implications for designing national research projects to realize hydrogen economy.\n",

      "Converting surplus renewable electricity into hydrogen by electrolyzers has been recognized as a promising scheme to reduce renewable energy spillage and to meet the increasing hydrogen demand. However, the scheme is challenged by the inherent spatiotemporal imbalance between renewable energy and hydrogen demand. Seasonal storages and interregional hydrogen supply chains (HSCs) are commonly employed in the literature to eliminate this imbalance, but long-distance hydrogen transportation can be costly. In this paper, we incorporated the electric network (EN) into the HSC for its ability to promptly and economically deliver energy at long distances. The uniform hierarchical time discretization method is utilized to achieve the unified operation of the HSC and the EN. On this basis, an integrated HSC-EN model is elaborated upon to investigate the optimal investment and operation of electrolyzers and storage. Finally, an industrial case in Sichuan province, China is analyzed to illustrate the benefits of incorporating the EN to reduce the investment cost and improve electrolyzers utilization.\n",

      "Low carbon hydrogen can be an excellent source of clean energy, which can combat global climate change and poor air quality. Hydrogen based economy can be a great opportunity for a country like Qatar to decarbonize its multiple sectors including transportation, shipping, global energy markets, and industrial sectors. However, there are still some barriers to the realization of a hydrogen-based economy, which includes large scale hydrogen production cost, infrastructure investments, bulk storage, transport & distribution, safety consideration, and matching supply-demand uncertainties. This paper highlights how the aforementioned challenges can be handled strategically through a multi-sector industrial-urban symbiosis for the hydrogen supply chain implementation. Such symbiosis can enhance the mutual relationship between diverse industries and urban planning by exploring varied scopes of multi-purpose hydrogen usage (i.e., clean energy source as a safer carrier, industrial feedstock and intermittent products, vehicle and shipping fuel, and international energy trading, etc.) both in local and international markets. It enables individual entities and businesses to participate in the physical exchange of materials, by-products, energy, and water, with strategic advantages for all participants. Besides, waste/by-product exchanges, several different kinds of synergies are also possible, such as the sharing of resources and shared facilities. The diversified economic base, regional proximity and the facilitation of rules, strategies and policies may be the key drivers that support the creation of a multi-sector hydrogen supply chain in Qatar.\n",

      "A core theme of the UK Government's new Industrial Strategy is exploiting opportunities for domestic supply chain development. This extends to a special ‘Automotive Sector Deal’ that focuses on the shift to low emissions vehicles (LEVs). Here attention is on electric vehicle and battery production and innovation. In this paper, we argue that a more straightforward gain in terms of framing policy around potential economic benefits may be made through supply chain activity to support refuelling of battery/hydrogen vehicles. We set this in the context of LEV refuelling supply chains potentially replicating the strength of domestic upstream linkages observed in the UK electricity and/or gas industries. We use input-output multiplier analysis to deconstruct and assess the structure of these supply chains relative to that of more import-intensive petrol and diesel supply. A crucial multiplier result is that for every £1million of spending on electricity (or gas), 8 full-time equivalent jobs are supported throughout the UK. This compares to less than 3 in the case of petrol/diesel supply. Moreover, the importance of service industries becomes apparent, with 67% of indirect and induced supply chain employment to support electricity generation being located in services industries. The comparable figure for GDP is 42%.\n",

      " \n",
      "With regard to the Fukushima Daiichi accident in 2011 and Japan's goal to reduce CO2 emission, the Japanese government strives for an emission free “hydrogen society” in which hydrogen will be the primary energy medium. The import of hydrogen generated by means of CO2 free wind electricity from overseas can be a promising option for Japan's prospective energy supply. Besides different other factors like specific costs of electrolyzers and hydrogen shipment over long distances, the economically reasonable export of hydrogen based on renewable energy requires low levelized costs of electricity. Within the scope of this study, the underlying idea of a hydrogen supply chain is taken up and revisited by means of a spatially highly resolved wind energy potential analysis and a detailed investigation of the supply chain elements between Patagonia and Japan. Our analysis reveals that approximately 25% of the total land area in Patagonia would be eligible. Approx. 33,000 turbines with a minimum number of 4500 full-load hours with an overall capacity of about 115 GW can be positioned. Taking into consideration the related average number of 4750 full-load hours and an electrolysis efficiency of 0.7, this leads to a potential production of about 11.5 million tons/year of hydrogen. So the wind power potential of Patagonia would theoretically be sufficient for the assumed Japanese hydrogen demand of 8.83 million tons/year. The total hydrogen pretax cost would amount to approx. 4.40 €/kgH2 at a liquid state at the harbor of Yokohama. Hence, the final specific costs of hydrogen in Japan depend on the expansion of wind power in Patagonia and therefore hydrogen based on wind energy can be cost-competitive to conventional fuels.\n",

      "The mathematical model for carbon capture, utilization and storage supply chains is developed for Italian regions. This model is used to design supply chains minimizing total costs and reducing significantly carbon dioxide emissions. Carbon dioxide can be stored or utilized to produce methane through a power to gas system, where hydrogen is obtained by the electrolysis of water using renewable power while methane is fed to the gas grid. The Mixed Integer Linear Program model is applied to design carbon systems developed for ten regions with major carbon dioxide emissions, while different saline aquifers are proposed as storage sites. Results show that the Adriatic sea is the most appropriate offshore storage site in the supply chain. This leads to a lower net methane production cost and to the lowest level of economic incentives as compared to other cases. The total costs of this supply chain are 7.34·104 million €/year (953 €/tonCO2 captured), and 16.1 Mton/year of methane are produced. The supply chain does not result economically favorable without substantial financial incentives (80 €/tonCO2 for carbon tax and 260 €/MWh economic incentive for methane production). Comparing supply chains that include simultaneous utilization and storage of carbon dioxide with a carbon capture and utilization supply chain (without storage) shows that the latter is economically less favorable. In addition to mitigation of carbon environmental impact for the whole Country, the large scale supply chain proposed here meets 35% of Italy’s methane demand as a whole, a significant contribution to a global economic perspective, widely discussed nowadays, which should include self-sustainment elements at regional level.\n",

      "In this article, we address the design of hydrogen supply chains for vehicle use with economic and environmental concerns. Given a set of available technologies to produce, store, and deliver hydrogen, the problem consists of determining the optimal design of the production-distribution network capable of satisfying a predefined hydrogen demand. The design task is formulated as a bi-criterion mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem, which simultaneously accounts for the minimization of cost and environmental impact. The environmental impact is measured through the contribution to climate change made by the hydrogen network operation. The emissions considered in the analysis are those associated with the entire life cycle of the process, and are quantified according to the principles of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). To expedite the search of the Pareto solutions of the problem, we introduce a bi-level algorithm that exploits its specific structure. A case study that addresses the optimal design of the hydrogen infrastructure needed to fulfill the expected hydrogen demand in Great Britain is introduced to illustrate the capabilities of the proposed approach. © 2009 American Institute of Chemical Engineers AIChE J, 2010\n",

Retrofit energy supply-chains, from generation to end product, encompass fossil fuel energy generation with retrofitted carbon capture and storage (CCS), for clean energy [hydrogen] output. Three research questions are posited: can an energy security framework be identified for analysis of fossil fuel retrofit hydrogen exports; what findings arise from applying the framework to a case study of Australian exports of coal-generated hydrogen to Japan; and are such international energy systems compromised by sub-optimal carbon-emitting supply chains, with potential implications for global energy justice? A systematic literature review identified a modified framework, further developed in this article to catalyse global energy security-justice analysis; contributing a useful energy security-justice tool. Applying the framework, findings illustrate key opportunities in Australia/Japan’s energy diversification, supply security, and bilateral trade-strategic security relationships. Key risks include emissions and economic costs, risks in the production process, shipping complexities, and doubts concerning CCS. Interests of conservative politics and pro-coal/CCS influencers dominate how security is framed, deprioritising energy justice concerns and privileging coal interests and mining jobs over potentially more resilient renewable energy pathways and jobs.

      "An uninterrupted chain of energy supplies is the core of every activity, without exception for the operations of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. A robust and efficient energy supply is fundamental for the success of missions and a guarantee of soldier safety. However, organizing a battlefield energy supply chain is particularly challenging because the risks and threats are particularly high. Moreover, the energy supply chain is expected to be flexible according to mission needs and able to be moved quickly if necessary. In line with ongoing technological changes, the growing popularity of hydrogen is undeniable and has been noticed by NATO as well. Hydrogen is characterised by a much higher energy density per unit mass than other fuels, which means that hydrogen fuel can increase the range of military vehicles. Consequently, hydrogen could eliminate the need for risky refuelling stops during missions as well as the number of fatalities associated with fuel delivery in combat areas. Our research shows that a promising prospect lies in the mobile technologies based on hydrogen in combination with use of the nuclear microreactors. Nuclear microreactors are small enough to be easily transported to their destinations on heavy trucks. Depending on the design, nuclear microreactors can produce 1–20 MW of thermal energy that could be used directly as heat or converted to electric power or for non-electric applications such as hydrogen fuel production. The aim of the article is to identify a model of nuclear-hydrogen synergy for use in NATO operations. We identify opportunities and threats related to mobile energy generation with nuclear-hydrogen synergy in NATO operations. The research presented in this paper identifies the best method of producing hydrogen using a nuclear microreactor. A popular and environmentally “clean” solution is electrolysis due to the simplicity of the process. However, this is less efficient than chemical processes based on, for example, the sulphur-iodine cycle. The results of the research presented in this paper show which of the methods and which cycle is the most attractive for the production of hydrogen with the use of mini-reactors. The verification criteria include: the efficiency of the process, its complexity and the residues generated as a result of the process (waste)—all taking into account usage for military purposes.\n",

      "This paper explores the implications of siting a bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) facility to carbon emission performances for three case-study supply chains using the Carbon Navigation System (CNS) model. The three case-study supply chains are a wheat straw derived BECCS-power, a municipal solid waste derived BECCS-waste-to-energy and a sawmill residue derived BECCS-hydrogen. A BECCS facility needs to be carefully sited, taking into consideration its local low carbon infrastructure, available biomass and geography for successful deployment and achieving a favorable net-negative carbon balance. On average, across the three supply chains a 10 km shift in the siting of the BECCS facility results in an 8.6–13.1% increase in spatially explicit supply chain emissions. BECCS facilities producing low purity CO2 at high yields have lower spatial emissions when located within the industrial clusters, while those producing high purity CO2 at low yields perform better outside the clusters. A map is also generated identifying which of the three modeled supply chains delivers the lowest spatially explicit supply chain emission options for any given area of the UK at a 1 MtCO2/yr capture scale.\n",

      "A lot of recent studies have concluded that hydrogen could gradually become a much more significant component of the European energy mix for mobility and stationary fuel cell system applications. Yet, the challenge of developing a future commercial hydrogen economy still remains through the deployment of a viable hydrogen supply chain and an increasing fuel cell vehicle market share, which allows to narrow the existing cost difference regarding the conventional fossil fuel vehicle market. In this paper, the market penetration of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, as substitutes for internal combustion engine vehicles has been evaluated from a social and a subsidy-policy perspective from 2020 to 2050. For this purpose, the best compromise hydrogen supply chain network configuration after the sequential application of an optimization strategy and a multi-criteria decision-making tool has been assessed through a Social Cost-Benefit Analysis (SCBA) to determine whether the hydrogen mobility deployment increases enough the social welfare. The scientific objective of this work is essentially based on the development of a methodological framework to quantify potential societal benefits of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. The case study of the Occitania Region in France supports the analysis. The externality costs involve the abatement cost of CO2, noise and local pollution as well as platinum depletion. A subsidy policy scenario has also been implemented. For the case study considered, the results obtained that are not intended to be general, show that CO2 abatement dominates the externalities, platinum is the second largest externality, yet reducing the benefits obtained by the CO2 abatement. The positive externalities from air pollution and noise abatement almost reach to compensate for the negative costs caused by platinum depletion. The externalities have a positive effect from 2025. Using a societal cost accounting framework with externalities and subsidies, hydrogen transition timing is reduced by four years for the example considered.\n",

      "Hydrogen and its energy carriers, such as liquid hydrogen (LH2), methylcyclohexane (MCH), and ammonia (NH3), are essential components of low-carbon energy systems. To utilize hydrogen energy, the complete environmental merits of its supply chain should be evaluated. To understand the expected environmental benefit under the uncertainty of hydrogen technology development, we conducted life-cycle inventory analysis and calculated CO2 emissions and their uncertainties attributed to the entire supply chain of hydrogen and NH3 power generation (co-firing and mono-firing) in Japan. Hydrogen was assumed to be produced from overseas renewable energy sources with LH2/MCH as the carrier, and NH3 from natural gas or renewable energy sources. The Japanese life-cycle inventory database was used to calculate emissions. Monte Carlo simulations were performed to evaluate emission uncertainty and mitigation factors using hydrogen energy. For LH2, CO2 emission uncertainty during hydrogen liquefaction can be reduced by using low-carbon fuel. For MCH, CO2 emissions were not significantly affected by power consumption of overseas processes; however, it can be reduced by implementing low-carbon fuel and waste-heat utilization during MCH dehydrogenation. Low-carbon NH3 production processes significantly affected power generation, whereas carbon capture and storage during NH3 production showed the greatest reduction in CO2 emission. In conclusion, reducing CO2 emissions during the production of hydrogen and NH3 is key to realize low-carbon hydrogen energy systems.\n",

The raw material for hydrogen production is digester gas, a renewable energy source. The digester gas is processed into bio natural gas and hydrogen. The hydrogen is used in a combined heat and power plant with a hydrogen engine to produce electricity and heat to supply a nearby school. An attractive alternative to a hydrogen engine is a fuel cell. Fuel cells require hydrogen conforming to stricter quality standards than H2 engines; therefore trialling quality management methods with a model fuel cell is an important safeguard in order to protect downstream fuel cells if digester gas derived hydrogen is to be used.\n",

The study adopts a supply chain approach, estimating the emissions reduction potential of 20% ammonia co-combustion in coal-fired power stations in the country of use, and the emissions associated with ammonia production in the country of origin. The paper considers the emissions implications of using different ammonia production technologies: Haber-Bosch (HB) ammonia production with hydrogen generated from steam methane reforming using natural gas (SMR), with and without carbon capture and storage (CCS); Haber-Bosch ammonia production with hydrogen generated from renewable sources; and fully renewable electricity generated ammonia. The empirical setting of the study is an ammonia supply chain encompassing Japan and Australia. The results show co-combustion of ammonia produced with SMR-HB provides no net benefit for the combined country emissions, as ammonia production related greenhouse emissions in Australia are equivalent to the emission reductions in Japan. In contrast, co-firing ammonia produced from fully renewable sources reduces emissions in the two countries in 2030 by 43 MT per annum. SMR-HB processes with varying levels of CCS reduce annual emissions by 16–34 MT. Based on the results, different policy options are suggested for managing the emissions associated with a Japan-Australia ammonia supply chain.\n",

      "Promising electricity and hydrogen production chains with CO2 capture, transport and storage (CCS) and energy carrier transmission, distribution and end-use are analysed to assess (avoided) CO2 emissions, energy production costs and CO2 mitigation costs. For electricity chains, the performance is dominated by the impact of CO2 capture, increasing electricity production costs with 10–40% up to 4.5–6.5 €ct/kWh. CO2 transport and storage in depleted gas fields or aquifers typically add another 0.1–1€ct/kWh for transport distances between 0 and 200km. The impact of CCS on hydrogen costs is small. Production and supply costs range from circa 8€/GJ for the minimal infrastructure variant in which hydrogen is delivered to CHP units, up to 20€/GJ for supply to households. Hydrogen costs for the transport sector are between 14 and 16€/GJ for advanced large-scale coal gasification units and reformers, and over 20 €/GJ for decentralised membrane reformers. Although the CO2 price required to induce CCS in hydrogen production is low in comparison to most electricity production options, electricity production with CCS generally deserves preference as CO2 mitigation option. Replacing natural gas or gasoline for hydrogen produced with CCS results in mitigation costs over 100€/t CO2, whereas CO2 in the power sector could be reduced for costs below 60€/t CO2 avoided.\n",

The overall efficiency of the system, based on the energy analysis presented, would seem to be the final delivered electrical, fuel and useable heat energy delivered to end use divided by the input solar and wind energy. Furthermore, the environmental effects due to the introduction of the systems are evaluated considering the reduction of global warming and air pollution gases, such as CO2 and PM2.5. The proposed analysis method was applied considering a natural gas pipeline that connects Qinghai and Shanghai. As a result, conversion ratios of 24.9% for electricity and 17.5% for heat were achieved, with the overall efficiency of the system of 42.4% based on the electricity obtained from photovoltaics. 3.02 Gt of CO2, 104 kt of SOx, and 134 kt of NOx, which represent 3.3%, 0.5%, and 0.6% of the annual discharge in China, respectively, and 8.66 kt of PM2.5 would be reduced every year. Furthermore, a reduction of 953 Mt in coal consumption is expected. The payback period of the proposed system using the DCF method is 4.17 and 2.28 years for the two alternatives evaluated in this work. The cash flow of the DCF is influenced by installation cost and operation cost of equipment.\n",

      "As Australia moves toward decarbonisation across all of its sectors, the production and use of clean hydrogen have emerged as a clear alternative. It is versatile, storable, transportable and, ultimately, a fuel source that is carbon free. Funding and policy announcements across State and Federal Governments for the hydrogen industry have built momentum in recent years, with projects already underway to address new uses for hydrogen, which are looking to improve the economics of production to meet the expected future demand not only here in Australia but also internationally. So, how can Australia lead the global shift to hydrogen and what is the regulatory and fiscal infrastructure needed to drive the development of the hydrogen industry in Australia? The key issues to be considered include the following: The need for government funding for development of the future uses of hydrogen to help build confidence and stimulate investment across the supply chain to enable commercialisation; Establishing an attractive investment environment for projects in Australia – not only the production of hydrogen but also for the supply chain infrastructure; Development of a certification scheme and Australia’s role in setting regional and/or international standards and Policy settings, including the necessary regulatory and fiscal reforms, relevant to support the period of transition to green hydrogen.\n",

Further, the effects of climate change scenario discourage the use of biomass as a combustion fuel. An integrated renewable hydrogen model has been developed based on biomass feed stocks as the input material for hydrogen production. It has been found that hydrogen can be produced at rates comparable with steam methane reforming, which is one of the most economical methods of generating hydrogen. However, the model must have a strong statistical base and an up‐to‐date geographical information system to present accurate and logical results for effective energy planning.

      "The planning of a hydrogen infrastructure with production facilities, distribution chains, and refuelling stations is a hard task. Difficulties may rise essentially in the choice of the optimal configurations. An innovative design of hydrogen network has been proposed in this paper. It consists of a network of green hydrogen refuelling stations (GHRSs) and several production nodes. The proposed model has been formulated as a mathematical programming, where the main decisions are the selection of GHRSs that are powered by the production nodes based on distance and population density criteria, as well the energy and hydrogen flows exchanged among the system components from the production nodes to the demand points. The approaches and methodologies developed can be taken as a support to decision makers, stakeholders and local authorities in the implementation of new hydrogen infrastructures. Optimal configurations have been reported taking into account the presence of an additional hydrogen industrial market demand and a connection with the electrical network. The main challenge that has been treated within the paper is the technical feasibility of the hydrogen supply chain, that is mainly driven by uncertain, but clean solar and wind energy resources. Using a Northern Italian case study, the clean hydrogen produced can be technically considered feasible to supply a network of hydrogen refuelling stations. Results show that the demands are satisfied for each time period and for the market penetration scenarios adopted.\n",

      "This paper presents techno-economic modelling results of a nationwide hydrogen fuel supply chain (HFSC) that includes renewable hydrogen production, transportation, and dispensing systems for fuel cell electric buses (FCEBs) in Ireland. Hydrogen is generated by electrolysers located at each existing Irish wind farm using curtailed or available wind electricity. Additional electricity is supplied by on-site photovoltaic (PV) arrays and stored using lithium-ion batteries. At each wind farm, sizing of the electrolyser, PV array and battery is optimised system design to obtain the minimum levelised cost of hydrogen (LCOH). Results show the average electrolyser capacity factor is 64% after the integration of wind farm-based electrolysers with PV arrays and batteries. A location-allocation algorithm in a geographic information system (GIS) environment optimises the distributed hydrogen supply chain from each wind farm to a hypothetical hydrogen refuelling station in the nearest city. Results show that hydrogen produced, transported, and dispensed using this system can meet the entire current bus fuel demand for all the studied cities, at a potential LCOH of 5–10 €/kg by using available wind electricity. At this LCOH, the future operational cost of FCEBs in Belfast, Cork and Dublin can be competitive with public buses fuelled by diesel, especially under carbon taxes more reflective of the environmental impact of fossil fuels.\n",

This work is focused on the design of a hydrogen supply chain through mixed integer linear programming used to find the best solutions for a multi-objective optimization problem in which three objectives are involved, i.e., cost, global warming potential and safety risk. This problem is solved by implementing an ɛ-constraint method. The solution consists of a Pareto front, corresponding to different design strategies in the associated variable space. Multiple choice decision making is then recommended to find the best solution through an M-TOPSIS analysis. The model is applied to the Great Britain case study previously treated in the dedicated literature. Mono and multicriteria optimizations exhibit some differences concerning the degree of centralization of the network and the selection of the production technology type.\n",

Three different cases are considered, according to hydrogen production route required to correct the syngas composition: hydrogen by external reforming, hydrogen by external water electrolysis, hydrogen by internal steam reforming. Results show that absorption is the preferred capture solutions at high flue gas flow rate. Results also show that the best option is providing hydrogen by water electrolysis, because a higher amount of carbon dioxide is used to produce the same amount of methanol with lower environmental impact. The proposed network produces 203 Mton/year of methanol, then Germany would be able to satisfy the world methanol demand in the next years.

      "There is no doubt that energy will have one of highest priorities in agendas of strategic plans of countries. Since fossil fuels are running out and carbon emissions are more important than ever, researchers seek alternative clean and efficient energy sources. One of the best alternatives is hydrogen. The systems in which hydrogen flows from its production to end users are called hydrogen supply chains (HSC). Since hydrogen is not in active use, its HSC infrastructure is not complete and should be planned very carefully. We study the design of HSC of Turkey to meet the hydrogen demand of the period between 2021 and 2050. Our aim is to minimize total cost of the HSC while meeting the demand of the transportation sector. We address the problem by using a mixed integer programming (MIP) model and derive several insights for the future HSC. The results show that while decentralization (being able to fulfill the demand from local production facilities) is 12% in the first period, this rate raises up to 48% by the end of the planning horizon. Analysis also reveal that almost all grids do not produce and import hydrogen simultaneously, i.e., they either produce or import hydrogen. The results are robust in the sense that solutions of different optimality gaps have minor differences in terms of established facilities.\n",

The hydrogen economy concept, as set out in recent commissioned research investment policy advice documents, includes a range of hydrogen energy supply and consumption chains for transport and residential energy services. The benefits of research and development investments in these advice documents were not fully analyzed by cost or improvements in energy efficiency or green house gas emissions reduction. This paper sets out a straightforward method to quantify the system-level efficiency of these energy chains. The method was applied to transportation and stationary heat and power, with hydrogen generated from wind energy, natural gas and coal. The system-level efficiencies for the hydrogen chains were compared to direct use of conventionally generated electricity, and with internal combustion engines operating on gas- or coal-derived fuel. The hydrogen energy chains were shown to provide little or no system-level efficiency improvement over conventional technology. The current research investment policy is aimed at enabling a hydrogen economy without considering the dramatic loss of efficiency that would result from using this energy carrier.\n",

      "For hydrogen to play a meaningful role in a sustainable energy system, all elements of the value chain must scale coherently. Advocates support electrolytic (green) hydrogen or (blue) hydrogen that relies on methane reformation with carbon capture and storage; however, efforts to definitively choose how to deliver this scaling up are premature. For blue hydrogen, methane emissions must be minimized. Best in class supply chain management in combination with high rates of CO2 capture can deliver a low carbon hydrogen product. In the case of electrolytic hydrogen, the carbon intensity of power needs to be very low for this to be a viable alternative to blue hydrogen. Until the electricity grid is deeply decarbonized, there is an opportunity cost associated with using renewable energy to produce hydrogen, as opposed to integrating this with the power system. To have a realistic chance of success, net zero transition pathways need to be formulated in a way that is coherent with socio-political-economic constraints.\n",

The project addresses the present and future French hydrogen industrial markets for chemical and refinery uses, the analysis of the interplay between wind energy production and storage of hydrogen for different automotive requirements (refuelling stations, biofuel plants, Hydrogen/Natural Gas mix), the massive hydrogen storage to balance various supply and demand characteristics, and the supply network (pipeline option competitiveness vs. trucked in supply) to distribute hydrogen in a French region for automotive applications.

If hydrogen is produced by electrolysis from wind energy systems, the costs vary from ca. 4 to 20€/kg, depending strongly on the type of demand and the connexion rate to the grid. At a French regional scale, hydrogen use for transports needs mass storage (at least 103t) to balance a constant supply and a seasonal demand, the corresponding transport and distribution up to 2050 require pipelines and the costs could be limited to the reasonable values ca. 0.4–0.6€/kg.\n",

The energy demand required for the port was determined by establishing the leading small and large-scale conventional energy-consuming equipment. Hence, 60 kgH2 was required to ensure the power supply. The total electrical energy to produce all the hydrogen was generated from photovoltaic solar energy, considering three-generation scenarios (minimum, maximum and the annual average). In all cases, the energy supply in the electrolyzer was 3.08 MWe. In addition, the effect of generating in the port facility using a diesel generator and a fuel cell was compared. The cost of 1 kgH2 could be 4.09 times higher than the cost of 1 L of diesel, meaning that the output kWh of each system is economically similar. In addition, the value of electrical energy through a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) was a maximum of 79.79 times the value of a liter of diesel.

This paper examines the relative costs of carbon mitigation from a life cycle perspective for 12 different hydrogen production techniques using fossil fuels, nuclear energy and renewable sources by technology substitution. Production costs and life cycle emissions are parameterized and re-estimated from currently available assessments to produce robust ranges to describe uncertainties for each technology. Hydrogen production routes are then compared using a combination of metrics, levelized cost of carbon mitigation and the proportional decarbonization benchmarked against steam methane reforming, to provide a clearer picture of the relative merits of various hydrogen production pathways, the limitations of technologies and the research challenges that need to be addressed for cost-effective decarbonization pathways. The results show that there is a trade-off between the cost of mitigation and the proportion of decarbonization achieved. The most cost-effective methods of decarbonization still utilize fossil feedstocks due to their low cost of extraction and processing, but only offer moderate decarbonisation levels due to previous underestimations of supply chain emissions contributions. Methane pyrolysis may be the most cost-effective short-term abatement solution, but its emissions reduction performance is heavily dependent on managing supply chain emissions whilst cost effectiveness is governed by the price of solid carbon. Renewable electrolytic routes offer significantly higher emissions reductions, but production routes are more complex than those that utilise naturally-occurring energy-dense fuels and hydrogen costs are high at modest renewable energy capacity factors. Nuclear routes are highly cost-effective mitigation options, but could suffer from regionally varied perceptions of safety and concerns regarding proliferation and the available data lacks depth and transparency. Better-performing fossil-based hydrogen production technologies with lower decarbonization fractions will be required to minimise the total cost of decarbonization but may not be commensurate with ambitious climate targets.\n",

      "Renewably produced hydrogen offers a solution for mobility via fuel cell electric vehicles without emissions during driving. However, the hydrogen supply chain, from hydrogen production to the fueling station – incorporating seasonal storage and transport – varies in economic and environmental aspects depending on the technology used, as well as individual conditions, such as the distance between production and demand. Previous studies have focused on the economic aspects of varying technologies and elaborated application areas of each technology, while environmental issues were not specifically considered. To address this shortcoming, this paper presents a life cycle assessment of three supply chain architectures: (a) Liquid Organic Hydrogen Carriers (LOHCs hereinafter) for transport and storage; as well as (b) compressed hydrogen storage in salt caverns, together with pipelines; and (c) pressurized gas truck transport. The results of this study show that the pipeline solution has the least environmental impact with respect to most of the impact categories for all analyzed cases. Only for short distances, i.e., 100 km, is truck transport better in a few impact categories. When considering truck transport scenarios, LOHCs have higher environmental impacts than pressurized gas in seven out of 14 impact categories. Nevertheless, for longer distances, the difference is decreasing. The seasonal storage of hydrogen has almost no environmental influence, independent of the impact category, transport distance or hydrogen demand. In particular, strong scaling effects underlie the good performance of pipeline networks.\n",

      "Hydrogen is a promising energy carrier and feedstock alike for decarbonizing the energy, transport, and chemical sector and mitigating the effects of global warming. Identifying and realizing environmentally friendly hydrogen production pathways is, however, significantly impeded by the need for step-wise transformation of national energy systems. This paper reviews the current level of hydrogen production technology development. Nine process configurations based on four different process technologies were considered comprising steam methane reforming, steam methane reforming with carbon capture and storage, methane pyrolysis and polymer electrolyte membrane electrolysis. Hydrogen from these technologies is often associated with the respective colors grey, blue, turquoise, and green. The critical comparison of the technologies is objectified and quantified based on the methodology of life cycle assessment. For this purpose, the environmental impacts of the hydrogen production technologies are gathered and the most promising solutions with respect to the progressing energy transition identified thereby differentiating the approaches for their short, medium-, and long-term benefit. By considering sixteen impact categories, both, environmental co-benefits and burden shifting resulting from the transition to more climate-friendly hydrogen production technologies were taken into account. The environmental impact of the hydrogen production technologies was found to be determined to large extend by the underlying electricity and natural gas supply chains. Anticipating technology shifts and taking regional differences and future advances in national supply chains into account, technology recommendations deviate substantially for the countries considered.\n",

For the purpose, fundamental data for the open-jet hydrogen flame of high-pressurized hydrogen up to 80MPa have been accumulated. In this report, the scale of diffusion flame, flame stabilization, and radiation from flame are discussed. Furthermore, when the blown-down cloud of high pressure hydrogen was ignited at several tens milliseconds delay, the flame propagated at a high speed over 400m/s through the hydrogen-air mixture with a strong turbulence. Moreover, the outline of risk assessment and safety countermeasures for hydrogen supply station is introduced.\n",

      "This paper presents the results of a model of hydrogen production from waste biomass in California. We develop a profit-maximizing model of a biomass hydrogen industry from field to vehicle tank. This model is used to estimate the economic potential for hydrogen production from two waste biomass resources in Northern California—wheat straw and rice straw—taking into account the on the ground geographic dimensions of both biomass supply and hydrogen demand. The systems analysis approach allows for explicit consideration of the interactions between feedstock collection, hydrogen production, and hydrogen distribution in finding the optimal system design. This case study approach provides insight into both the real-world potential and the real-world cost of producing hydrogen from waste biomass. Additional context is provided through the estimation of California's total waste biomass hydrogen potential. We find that enough biomass is available from waste sources to provide up to 40% of the current California passenger car fuel demand as hydrogen. Optimized supply chains result in delivered hydrogen costing between $3/kg and $5.50/kg with one-tenth of the well-to-wheels greenhouse gas emissions of conventional gasoline-fueled vehicles.\n",

The key ingredient of our method is the use of an objective reduction algorithm that allows identifying redundant objectives that can be omitted while still preserving the problem structure to the extent possible.

      "Abstract                   The cost of delivered H2 using the liquid-distribution pathway will approach $4.3–8.0/kg in the USA and 26–52 RMB/kg in China by around 2030, assuming large-scale adoption. Historically, hydrogen as an industrial gas and a chemical feedstock has enjoyed a long and successful history. However, it has been slow to take off as an energy carrier for transportation, despite its benefits in energy diversity, security and environmental stewardship. A key reason for this lack of progress is that the cost is currently too high to displace petroleum-based fuels. This paper reviews the prospects for hydrogen as an energy carrier for transportation, clarifies the current drivers for cost in the USA and China, and shows the potential for a liquid-hydrogen supply chain to reduce the costs of delivered H2. Technical and economic trade-offs between individual steps in the supply chain (viz. production, transportation, refuelling) are examined and used to show that liquid-H2 (LH2) distribution approaches offer a path to reducing the delivery cost of H2 to the point at which it could be competitive with gasoline and diesel fuel.\n",

      "For an energy supply chain based on liquefied hydrogen, low parasitic energy consumption throughout the chain, from conversion to end-use, is a prerequisite for competitiveness with other energy carriers. The viability of the chain from the viewpoint of efficiency and cost is to a large extent dependent on the efficiency of the liquefier, which is the dominant power-consuming process in the chain. Hence, an innovative large-scale, high-efficiency hydrogen liquefier based on mixed-refrigerant (MR) pre-cooling has been developed. The liquefier employs MR pre-cooling down to a hydrogen temperature of 75 K while below this temperature, a reversed helium/neon Brayton cycle provides the requisite cooling. Two MR-based liquefier models have been derived. In the first, Joule–Thomson throttling valves are employed for MR expansion, while these have been replaced with liquid expanders in the second. With 21 bar hydrogen feed pressure and an ambient temperature of 300 K, the resulting figures for specific liquefaction power are 6.48 and 6.15kWh/kgLH2, respectively. Based on current models, a reduction in the range of 45–48% from that of state-of-the art may be obtainable.\n",

      "Pakistan's energy crisis can be diminished through the use of Renewable and alternative sources of energy. Hydrogen as an energy vector is likely to replace the fossil fuels in the future owing to the political, financial and environmental factors associated with the latter. In this regard it is imperative that conscious effort is directed towards the production of hydrogen from Renewable resources. Renewable energy resources are abundantly available in Pakistan. The need to produce Hydrogen from Renewable resources in Pakistan (or any developing economy) is investigated because it is possible to store vast amount of intermittent renewable energy for later use. Thus the introduction of Hydrogen in the energy supply chain implies the start of a Pakistan Hydrogen Economy. Many nations have developed the Hydrogen Energy Roadmap, and if Pakistan has to follow suite it is only possible through the employment of Renewable energy resources. This study estimates the potential of different Renewable resources available in Pakistan i.e. Solar, Wind, Geothermal, Biomass and Municipal Solid waste. An estimate is then made for the potential of producing hydrogen from various established technologies from each of these Renewable resources. A number of reviews have been published stating the availability and usage of Renewable energy in Pakistan; however no specific study has been focused on the use of Renewable resources for developing a Hydrogen economy or a power-to-gas system in Pakistan. This study concludes that that Biomass is the most feasible feedstock for developing a Hydrogen supply chain in Pakistan with a potential to generate 6.6 million tons of Hydrogen annually, followed by Solar PV that has a generation potential of 2.8 million tons and then Municipal solid waste with a capacity of 1 million ton per annum.\n",

      " \n",
      "Although hydrogen is identified to be the first choice of the energy industry in the future society, the severe shortage of hydrogen infrastructure hinders the development of the hydrogen economy. Therefore, by simultaneously integrating the planning and operation issues of a hydrogen supply chain network (HSCN) and taking the hydrogen demand of hydrogen fuel vehicles into account, this paper proposes a general optimization design model for a HSCN based on the off-grid wind-hydrogen coupling system to realize the scientific layout of hydrogen infrastructure and stimulate the transition of hydrogen energy. The uncertainties on both sides of the source and load of a HSCN are well-considered. Therein, the uncertainty of wind power is handled with chance constrained programming, while the uncertainty of hydrogen demand is addressed by a density-based clustering approach. The analysis focuses on a HSCN of Fujian Province, China and case study is conducted. Results show that the estimated hydrogen demand in Fujian Province over the course of a year is 0.197 million tons. The hydrogen production is located in Fuzhou, Quanzhou and Xiamen and the daily hydrogen production in Fuzhou is 309.11 ton/day, accounting for 57.48% of the total hydrogen production in Fujian Province. Since the revenue of the energy storage batteries cannot offset its high investment cost, the abnegation of the energy storage batteries in the HSCN is obtained. Compared with the deterministic HSCN, the total cost of the HSCN considering the uncertainties of wind power and hydrogen demand is reduced by 1.35%. The Levelized cost of hydrogen is 3.073–3.155$/kg and hydrogen production shows a significant scale effect. These results could provide information and direction to stakeholders, investors and policymakers for the planning of the future HSCN in Fujian Province to promote the tremendous development of the hydrogen industry.\n",

When assessed for a 2050 timeframe, PFCEVs require less electric infrastructure compared to BEVs, and less hydrogen infrastructure compared to FCEVs. In addition, until 100% zero-emission fuel supply chains are achieved, PFCEVs reduce GHG and CAP emissions to a greater extent than BEVs and FCEVs.\n",

      "Hydrogen fuel cell vehicles are currently facing two difficulties in achieving their general use: the lack of hydrogen refueling stations and high hydrogen prices. Hydrogen refueling stations are the middle stage for delivering hydrogen from its sources to consumers, and their location could be affected by the distributed locations of hydrogen sources and consumers. The reasonable siting and sizing of hydrogen refueling stations could both improve the hydrogen infrastructure and reduce regional consumers' cost of using hydrogen. By considering the hydrogen life cycle cost and using a commercial volume forecasting model, this paper creates a relatively thorough and comprehensive model for hydrogen station siting and sizing with the objective of achieving the optimal costs for consumers using hydrogen. The cost‐based model includes the selection of the hydrogen sources, transportation methods, and storage methods, and thus, the hydrogen supply chain can also be optimized. A numerical example is established in Section 4 with the solution algorithm and results. This paper presented a cost‐based model for siting and sizing of hydrogen refueling stations to reduce regional hydrogen fuel cell vehicle consumers' costs. This model considered the total costs of purchase costs and refueling costs and multi'source hydrogen supply. Besides, the sizes of hydrogen stations are optimized during siting.\n",

      "Hydrogen and fuel cell technologies are one solution for addressing the challenges that major airports are facing today, such as upward price trends of liquid hydrocarbon fuels, greenhouse gas emission regulations, and stricter noise and air pollutant emission regulations, especially for on-ground pollution. An airport can also be viewed as the center of a hydrogen ecosystem, around which multiple hydrogen users could be clustered, with cost sharing of hydrogen production and storage occurring among users. The main novelty of the present work is the design of a hydrogen infrastructure irrigated by the airport ecosystem that satisfies the airport ecosystem energy needs. For this purpose, the model development is based on a multiobjective optimization framework designed to consider four echelons: energy sources, hydrogen production, transportation, and storage. The multiperiod problem is then solved using the ε-constraint method. Two objective functions are involved, that is, the total daily cost (TDC) of the network and an environmental indicator based on the global warming potential. The second innovative contribution is to model the demand uncertainty using fuzzy concepts for a hydrogen supply chain design. Because hydrogen demand is one the most significant parameters, the uncertainty of the demand has been considered using a proposed fuzzy linear programming strategy. The solutions are compared with the original crisp model, giving more robustness to the proposed approach. This work has been performed in the framework of the Hyport meta-project and, in particular, within the “H2 modeling” project. This paper focuses on a hydrogen airport ecosystem located in the department of Hautes-Pyrénées (France). However, the developed methodology could be extended to other hydrogen ecosystems for which deployment involves a multiperiod multi-objective formulation under an uncertain demand.\n",

      "Injection of hydrogen into existing natural gas grids, either partially or as a complete conversion, could decarbonise heat and take advantage of the inherent flexibility that gas grids provide in a low-carbon future. However, hydrogen injection is not straightforward due to the differing properties of the gases and the need for low-cost, low-carbon hydrogen supply chains. In this study, an up-to-date assessment of the opportunities and challenges for hydrogen injection is provided. Through value chain optimisation, the outlook for hydrogen injection is considered in the context of a national energy system with a high reliance on natural gas. The optimisation captures the operational details of hydrogen injection and gas grid flexibility, whilst also modelling the wider context, including interactions with the electricity system and delivery of energy from primary resource to end-use. It is found that energy systems are ready for partial hydrogen injection now and that relatively low feed-in tariffs (£20–50/MWh) could incentivise it. Partial hydrogen injection could provide a stepping stone for developing a hydrogen infrastructure but large scale decarbonisation of gas grids requires complete conversion to hydrogen. Whether this solution is preferable to electrification in the long term will depend on the value of the gas grid linepack flexibility and the costs of expanding electricity infrastructure.\n",

      "Hydrogen has an instrumental role to play in shaping the future of the UK's transport system. Huge reductions in ‘Greenhouse Gas’ (GHG) emissions may be achievable whilst providing a secure source of clean and sustainable fuel. Hydrogen transition has already begun but to strengthen and power the ‘hydrogen economy’ momentum in the UK, the development of the hydrogen infrastructure needs to make progress more quickly. There are many challenges associated with this due to the complexity at each node of Hydrogen Supply Chains (HSC), such as the number of processes to produce hydrogen. This raises the challenge to model HSCs, allowing analysis of various pathways and optimal configurations. This report aims firstly, to review the factors discussed in the literature on HSC and identify gaps or issues that require further debate with regards to introducing hydrogen in the transport system. Secondly, various HSC modelling techniques have been categorised according to mathematical methods used and the factors being considered. Studies in the literature have analysed hydrogen transport systems in terms of capital and operating costs of the infrastructure, and the cost of hydrogen, environmental implications and risk. A significant market share can be obtained by hydrogen in the near future with the minimisation of cost across the supply chain from production to end-use. Effective policies are required to speed up the process and increase the energy efficiency alongside mitigating GHGs and improving fuel security. Further developments in the mathematical optimisation models and technical breakthrough will enable the transition to a hydrogen economy take place with minimum disruption and issues.\n",

      "With the proposal of carbon neutrality goals and hydrogen energy development strategies in various countries, the development and construction of hydrogen supply chains have become important priorities. However, existing research has paid little attention to the hydrogen market and pricing. Therefore, a hydrogen pricing method based on marginal pricing theory is proposed in this paper, which adapts to hydrogen systems with renewable-to-hydrogen as a major source, in the future. A hydrogen energy market is established to define the industrial chain of hydrogen and the hydrogen trading process. The hydrogen market-clearing model is formulated considering a dynamic line pack. Due to its nonconvexity, the model is equivalently converted into mixed-integer second-order cone programming, and the optimality gap is minimized by introducing a penalty term. Based on the clearing solution, the concept and calculation method of the locational marginal hydrogen price (LMHP) are proposed with respect to the locational marginal price (LMP) in electricity markets. Case studies based on a modified Belgium 20-node gas network and Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Maryland (PJM) market operation data demonstrate the consistency between LMHP and LMP.\n",

The technological challenges are significant and have suppressed its presence in the energy transition story thus far, but this is changing fast. The hydrogen market faces a chicken-and-egg conundrum. Demand growth remains limited, hindered by uncertainty over supply and cost. But investment in hydrogen supply is restricted by ambiguity over its role in the future energy mix. Nonetheless, government policy and funding in Japan, China and Korea is creating new demand centres. Will the breakthrough be in power generation, transportation or energy storage? The costs associated with hydrogen production and transportation are its biggest hurdles. But new technologies around liquid organic hydrogen carriers and ammonia are emerging. How is this hydrogen+ philosophy evolving, and could it be a future competitive advantage? Over the past decade, we have already seen how new technology has rapidly reduced other renewable energy costs. We outline our view on whether the same could happen with hydrogen. So, where does Australia fit into this picture, and what is its competitive advantage? Australia is well endowed with natural resources, many of which can reliably generate renewable energy. And with numerous ongoing hydrogen pilot programs, it is uniquely positioned to innovate and export green hydrogen know-how. Can Australia become the global laboratory for hydrogen supply-chain technology?

      "Hydrogen is one of the most promising energy carriers in the quest for a more sustainable energy mix. In this paper, a model of the hydrogen supply chain (HSC) based on energy sources, production, storage, transportation, and market has been developed through a MILP formulation (Mixed Integer Linear Programming). Previous studies have shown that the start-up of the HSC deployment may be strongly penalized from an economic point of view. The objective of this work is to perform a sensitivity analysis to identify the major parameters (factors) and their interaction affecting an economic criterion, i.e., the total daily cost (TDC) (response), encompassing capital and operational expenditures. An adapted methodology for this SA is the design of experiments through the Factorial Design and Response Surface methods. Six key parameters are chosen (demand, capital change factor (CCF), storage and production capital costs (SCC, PCC), learning rate (LR), and unit production cost (UPC)). The demand is the factor that is by far the most significant parameter that strongly conditions the TDC optimization criterion, the second most significant parameter being the capital change factor. To a lesser extent, the other influencing factors are PCC and LR. The main interactions are found between demand, CCF, UPC, and SCC. The discussion has also shown that the calculation of UPC has to be improved taking into account the contribution of the fixed, electricity, and feedstock costs instead of being considered as a fixed parameter only depending on the size of the production unit. As any change that could occur relative to demand or CCF could strongly affect the response variable, more effort is also needed to find the more consistent way to model demand uncertainty in HSC design, especially since a long horizon time is considered for hydrogen deployment.\n",

      "The interest in low-carbon hydrogen technologies is growing fast in politics and the economy. The ramp-up of a hydrogen market is a critical phase, which requires the engagement and coordination of many heterogeneous stakeholders. A better understanding of who these stakeholders are and what relationships, chances, and risks they perceive is crucial to guide a hydrogen market ramp-up. This paper conducts a stakeholder analysis for Germany with a focus on the market ramp-up period. Interviews with 36 hydrogen experts, literature, and stakeholders from 78 real-world hydrogen research and demonstration projects are analysed with qualitative content analysis and social network analysis. In total, 49 stakeholder groups are identified and defined accordingly. The results indicate that established stakeholders’ roles will significantly change in a future hydrogen market. Risks range from economic and supply chain risks to impacts on international policy. Chances are found along economic, ecological, and political dimensions. Political intervention during the market ramp-up should mostly focus on the economic gap between low-carbon hydrogen and fossil alternatives and on prioritising the allocation of scarce hydrogen supply on heterogeneous demand. Simultaneously, a long-term strategy should be envisaged to guarantee a competitive and non-discriminatory hydrogen market in the future.\n",

      "Presented on Wednesday 18 May: Session 20 The global energy trade is set for its greatest transformation since the 1970s and the rise of OPEC (The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries). Electrification is central to this as countries plough money into renewables to reduce emissions and enhance energy security. But electrification can take the world only so far. With higher carbon prices looming on the horizon, fossil fuel exporters and industrial sectors – as well as heavy-duty trucking, shipping and aviation – need alternatives to decarbonise. Most are looking to electricity-based fuels and feedstocks such as hydrogen, ammonia and methanol to replace hydrocarbons. This will revolutionise energy trade, with total trade declining by as much as 50% and virtually all remaining traded oil gas and coal being either completely decarbonised or backed by offsets. With 147 GWel (giga‐watts electrolyser capacity) in announced projects, green hydrogen produced from renewable electricity is ahead of the game. And while its export supply chains are complex, requiring conversion into a ‘product’ to allow delivery, there is no exploration risk as in oil and gas projects. Worldwide, national hydrogen roadmaps are being passed, with virtually all oil and gas companies, utilities and industrials backing at least one hydrogen project. Focus is now shifting to future sources of hydrogen supply. Lenders will be drawn to locations with a proven track record of exporting natural resources, suitable conditions for low-cost renewable electricity and the potential for large-scale carbon capture. A few countries already stand out, but none more so than Australia. Using our proprietary research, we will present a case study evaluating hydrogen supply options from Australia, Saudi Arabia and Canada – delivered into key markets like Japan for different applications.

      "The global energy trade is set for its greatest transformation since the 1970s and the rise of OPEC (The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries). Electrification is central to this as countries plough money into renewables to reduce emissions and enhance energy security. But electrification can take the world only so far. With higher carbon prices looming on the horizon, fossil fuel exporters and industrial sectors – as well as heavy-duty trucking, shipping and aviation – need alternatives to decarbonise. Most are looking to electricity-based fuels and feedstocks such as hydrogen, ammonia and methanol to replace hydrocarbons. This will revolutionise energy trade, with total trade declining by as much as 50% and virtually all remaining traded oil gas and coal being either completely decarbonised or backed by offsets. With 147 GWel (giga‐watts electrolyser capacity) in announced projects, green hydrogen produced from renewable electricity is ahead of the game. And while its export supply chains are complex, requiring conversion into a ‘product’ to allow delivery, there is no exploration risk as in oil and gas projects. Worldwide, national hydrogen roadmaps are being passed, with virtually all oil and gas companies, utilities and industrials backing at least one hydrogen project. Focus is now shifting to future sources of hydrogen supply. Lenders will be drawn to locations with a proven track record of exporting natural resources, suitable conditions for low-cost renewable electricity and the potential for large-scale carbon capture. A few countries already stand out, but none more so than Australia. Using our proprietary research, we will present a case study evaluating hydrogen supply options from Australia, Saudi Arabia and Canada – delivered into key markets like Japan for different applications. We will also assess when costs will fall across the value chain – production, midstream and downstream – and reach parity to incumbent fuels.\n",

      "The use of intermittent renewable energy sources for power supply to off-grid electricity consumers requires either additional power sources or energy storage solutions, in order to manage the time mismatch between energy production and load requirements.We investigate in this paper the interest of a hybrid solar energy system, including a lithium-based batteries bank and a hydrogen chain (electrolyser, gas storages and fuel cell), for an off-grid application. This system is compared with two reference cases: PV-diesel generator and PV-Batteries. These different systems have been represented using empirical and semi-empirical models and are simulated with the CEA made ODYSSEY platform.The originality of our study lies in the simultaneous optimisation of the power management strategy and the components’ size, and in the detailed modelling of the components (power consumption of the auxiliaries and ageing approach in the form of performances degradation).The PV-Batteries-H2 system is operated by an efficient power management strategy and its optimal sizing is assessed on the basis of technical (e.g. load satisfaction) and economic (e.g. levelized cost of electricity) criteria. The results highlight the important role of the hydrogen chain in reducing the cost of the supplied energy. It is also shown that performances degradation of the hydrogen chain has a limited impact on the system optimal sizing and economic results.\n",

      "Decarbonised steel, enabled by green hydrogen-based iron ore reduction and renewable electricity-based steel making, will disrupt the traditional supply chain. Focusing on the energetic and techno-economic assessment of potential green supply chains, this study investigates the direct reduced iron-electric arc furnace production route enabled by renewable energy and deployed in regional settings. The hypothesis, that co-locating manufacturing processes with renewable energy resources would offer highest energy efficiency and cost reduction, is tested through an Australia-Japan case study. The binational partnership is structured to meet Japanese steel demand (for domestic use and regional exports) and source both energy and iron ore from the Pilbara region of Western Australia. A total of 12 unique supply chains differentiated by spatial configuration, timeline and energy carrier were simulated, which validated the hypothesis: direct energy and ore exports to remote steel producers (i.e. Japan-based production), as opposed to co-locating iron and steel production with abundant ore and renewable energy resources (i.e. Australia-based production), increased energy consumption and the levelised cost of steel by 45% and 32%, respectively, when averaged across 2030 and 2050. Two decades of technological development and economies of scale realisation would be crucial; 2030 supply chains were on average 12% more energy-intense and 23% more expensive than 2050 equivalents. On energy vectors, liquefied hydrogen was more efficient than ammonia for export-dominant supply chains due to the pairing of its process flexibility and the intermittent solar energy profile, as well as the avoidance of the need for ammonia cracking prior to direct reduction. To mitigate the green premium, a carbon tax in the range of A$66–192/t CO2 would be required in 2030 and A$0–70/t CO2 in 2050; the diminished carbon tax requirement in the latter is achievable only by wholly Australia-based production. Further, the modelled system scale was immense; producing 40 Mtpa of decarbonised steel will require 74–129% of Australia’s current electricity output and A$137–328 billion in capital investment for solar power, production, and shipping vessel infrastructure. These results call for strategic planning of regional resource pairing to drive energy and cost efficiencies which accelerate the global decarbonisation of steel.\n",

      "Supply chain management (SCM) has recently gained wider interest in both academia and industry given its potential to improve the benefits of a company through an integrated coordination of all its entities. Optimization problems in SCM are commonly cast as large scale mixed-integer linear programs (MILPs) that are hard to solve in short CPU times. This limitation is critical in spatially explicit SCM models since they require a large number of discrete variables to represent the geographical configuration of the network, which leads to complex MILPs. We present herein a novel solution method for this type of problems that combines the strengths of standard branch and cut techniques with the efficiency of large neighbourhood search (LNS). We illustrate the capabilities of this novel approach through its application to two case studies arising in energy applications: the design of supply chains (SCs) for bioethanol production and the strategic planning of hydrogen infrastructures for vehicle use.\n",

Given is a superstructure of alternatives that embeds a set of available technologies to produce, store and deliver hydrogen. The objective of our study is to determine the optimal design of the production–distribution network capable of fulfilling a predefined hydrogen demand. The design task is formulated as a multi-scenario mixed-integer linear problem (MILP) that considers the uncertainty associated with the coefficients of the objective function of the model (i.e. operating costs, raw materials prices, etc.). The novelty of the approach presented is that it allows controlling the variation of the economic performance of the hydrogen network in the space of uncertain parameters. This is accomplished by using a risk metric that is appended to the objective function as an additional criterion to be optimized. An efficient decomposition method is also presented in order to expedite the solution of the underlying multi-objective model by exploiting its specific structure. The capabilities of the proposed modeling framework and solution strategy are illustrated through the application to a real case study based on Spain, for which valuable insights are obtained.\n",

      " \n",
      "Green ammonia production as an important application for propelling the upcoming hydrogen economy has not been paid much attention by China, the world's largest ammonia producer. As a result, related studies are limited. This paper explores potential supply chain design and planning strategies of green ammonia production in the next decade of China with a case study in Inner Mongolia. A hybrid optimization-based simulation approach is applied, considering traditional optimization approaches are insufficient to address uncertainties and dynamics in a long-term energy transition. Results show that the production cost of green ammonia will be at least twice that of the current level due to higher costs of hydrogen supply. Production accounts for the largest share of the total expense of green hydrogen (~80 %). The decline of electricity and electrolyser prices are key in driving down the overall costs. In addition, by-product oxygen is also considered in the model to assess its economic benefits. We found that by-product oxygen sales could partly reduce the total expense of green hydrogen (~12 % at a price of USD 85/t), but it also should be noted that the volatile price of oxygen may pose uncertainties and risks to the effectiveness of the offset. Since the case study may represent the favourable conditions in China due to the abundant renewable energy resources and large-scale ammonia industry in this region, we propose to take a moderate step towards green ammonia production, and policies should be focused on reducing the electricity price and capital investments in green hydrogen production. We assume the findings and implications are informative to planning future green ammonia production in China.\n",

      "The technological barriers against energy transport includes low energy density, intermittent supply and immobility of the energy sources. A potential and sustainable solution to overcome these barriers is to use an effective and efficient energy carrier which can store, transport and distribute energy in a technically feasible manner. Therefore, this study presents five potential energy carriers for overseas energy transport; liquifed natural gas (LNG), dimethyl ether (DME), liquid ammonia, methanol and liquid hydrogen which are used to carry the energy of natural gas in liquefied form from a supplied region to a demanded region. During the supply chain of the energy carriers, the amount of boil-off gas (BOG) for each energy carrier is calculated. A sensitivity analysis affecting BOG rates is implemented under variety of parameters, namely; ambient temperature, storage pressure, land storage time, ocean transportation time, heel percentage and pumping time. This study shows that the daily BOG rates for LNG, DME, ammonia, methanol, and hydrogen are calculated as 0.471%, 0.159%, 0.129%, 0.049%, and 3.438%, respectively. Methanol delivers the greatest mass, DME delivers the greatest energy and hydrogen loses the greatest mass as BOG during the supply chain. The highest BOG generation mainly occurs during ocean transportation phase, implying that ocean transportation time is the most critical parameter among the studied parameters.\n",

      "Hydrogen-supported nitrogenase activity was demonstrated in Anabaena cylindrica cultures limited for reductant. Nitrogen-fixing Anabaena cylindrica cultures sparged in the light with anaerobic gases in the presence of the photosynthesis inhibitor DCMU slowly lost their ability to reduce acetylene in the light under argon but exhibited near normal activities in the presence of 11% H2 (balance argon). The hydrogen-supported nitrogenase activity was half-saturated between 2 and 3% H2 and was strongly inhibited by oxygen (50% inhibition at about 5–6% O2). Batch cultures of Anabaena cylindrica approaching stationary growth phase (“old” cultures) lost nitrogenase-dependent hydrogen evolution almost completely. In these old cultures hydrogen relieved the inhibitory effects of DCMU and O2 on acetylene reduction. Our results suggest that heterocysts contain an uptake hydrogenase which supplies an electron transport chain to nitrogenase but which couples only poorly with the respiratory chain in heterocysts and does not function in CO2 fixation by vegetative cells.\n",

Alternative scenarios were assessed for the hydrogen system chain from large scale production to final utilization. Hydrogen transportation and delivery was included in the analysis. The inherent safety fingerprint of each system was quantified by a set of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). Rules for KPIs aggregation were considered for the overall assessment of the system chains. The final utilization stage resulted by large the more important for the overall expected safety performance of the system. Thus, comparison was carried out with technologies proposed for the use of other low emission fuels, as LPG and natural gas. The hazards of compressed hydrogen-fueled vehicles resulted comparable, while reference innovative hydrogen technologies evidenced a potentially higher safety performance. Thus, switching to the inherently safer technologies currently under development may play an important role in the safety enhancement of hydrogen vehicles, resulting in a relevant improvement of the overall safety performance of the entire hydrogen system.\n",

      " \n",
      "Hydrogen can be produced from the decomposition of methane (also called pyrolysis). Many studies assume that this process emits few greenhouse gas (GHG) because the reaction from methane to hydrogen yields only solid carbon and no CO2. This paper assesses the life-cycle GHG emissions and the levelized costs for hydrogen provision from methane decomposition in three configurations (plasma, molten metal, and thermal gas). The results of these configurations are then compared to electrolysis and steam methane reforming (SMR) with and without CO2 capture and storage (CCS). Under the global natural gas supply chain conditions, hydrogen from methane decomposition still causes significant GHG emissions between 43 and 97 g CO2-eq./MJ. The bandwidth is predominately determined by the energy source providing the process heat, i.e. the lowest emissions are caused by the plasma system using renewable electricity. This configuration shows lower GHG emissions compared to the “classical” SMR (99 g CO2-eq./MJ) but similar emissions to the SMR with CCS (46 gCO2-eq./MJ). However, only electrolysis powered with renewable electricity leads to very low GHG emissions (3 g CO2-eq./MJ). Overall, the natural gas supply is a decisive factor in determining GHG emissions. A natural gas supply with below-global average GHG emissions can lead to lower GHG emissions of all methane decomposition configurations compared to SMR. Methane decomposition systems (1.6 to 2.2€/kg H2) produce hydrogen at costs substantially higher compared to SMR (1.0to1.2€/kg) but lower than electrolyser (2.5to 3.0€/kg). SMR with CCS has the lowest CO2 abatement costs (24€/t CO2-eq., other > 141€/t CO2-eq.). Finally, fuels derived from different hydrogen supply options are assessed. Substantially lower GHG emissions, compared to the fossil reference (natural gas and diesel/gasoline), are only possible if hydrogen from electrolysis powered by renewable energy is used (>90% less). The other hydrogen pathways cause only slightly lower or even higher GHG emissions.\n",

We investigated the feasibility of such a system through numerical simulations by taking into account both mass and energy balances, and adsorption thermodynamics. We showed that high-pressure hydrogen, up to 70 MPa, can be obtained by simply lowering and/or increasing the system temperature.

      "Hydrogen is currently receiving significant attention and investment as a key enabler of defossilised global energy systems. Many believe this will eventually result in the international trade of hydrogen as a commodity from countries with significant renewable energy resources, for example New Zealand and Australia, to net energy importing countries including Japan and Korea. Japan has, since 2014, been actively exploring the components of the necessary supply chains, including the assessment of different hydrogen carriers. Public/private partnerships have invested in demonstration projects to assess the comparative merits of liquid hydrogen, ammonia, and organic carriers. On the supply side, significant projects have been proposed in Australia while the impending closure of New Zealand’s Tiwai Point aluminium smelter at the end of 2024 may provide an opportunity for green hydrogen production. However, it is also evident that the transition to a hydrogen economy will take some years and confidence around the timing of supply and demand capacity is essential for new energy infrastructure investment. This paper reviews the expected development of an export market to Japan and concludes that large scale imports are unlikely before the late 2020s. Comparative evaluation of the energy efficiency of various hydrogen carriers concludes that it is too early to call a winner, but that ammonia has key advantages as a fungible commodity today, while liquid hydrogen has the potential to be a more efficient energy carrier. Ultimately it will be the delivered cost of hydrogen that will determine which carriers are used, and while energy efficiency is a key metric, there are other considerations such as infrastructure availability, and capital and operating costs.\n",

      "Hydrogen is becoming an increasingly appealing energy carrier, as the costs of renewable energy generation and water electrolysis continue to decline. Developing scalable modeling and decision tools for the H$_{2}$ supply chain that fully capture the flexibility of various resources is essential to understanding the overall cost-competitiveness of H$_{2}$ use. Here, we develop a H$_{2}$ supply chain planning model that determines the least-cost mix of H$_{2}$ generation, storage, transmission, and compression facilities to meet H$_{2}$ demands and is coupled with power systems through electricity prices. We incorporate flexible scheduling for H$_{2}$ trucks and pipeline, allowing them to serve as both H$_{2}$ transmission and storage resources to shift H$_{2}$ demand/production across space and time. The proposed model provides a reasonable trade-off between modeling accuracy and computational time, with linear relaxations for truck inventory routing and H$_{2}$ production unit commitment. The case study results in the U.S. Northeast indicate that the proposed flexible scheduling of H$_{2}$ transmission and storage resources is critical not only to cost minimization but also to the choice of H$_{2}$ production pathways between electrolysis and natural gas based production. Trucks as mobile storage could make intermittent electrolytic H$_{2}$ production more competitive by providing extra spatiotemporal flexibility.\n",

      "Green hydrogen will play a key role in the future energy transition to achieve the main decarbonization goals. However, many large economies have limited renewable energy generation capacity, which leads to the identification of strategic sites for the global export of hydrogen. The aim of this work is to investigate the techno-economic feasibility of green hydrogen production in Argentine Patagonia with subsequent ship transport to Italy. The study includes the entire supply chain, from the production of hydrogen with renewable energy sources to its final use as a fuel for mobility in Italy. Different scenarios have been identified and compared, considering that the hydrogen production can take place directly in Italy or in Patagonia, followed by a transport to Italy. It was assumed that hydrogen is produced through PEM electrolyzers powered by wind energy. Various hydrogen transport and storage methods were analyzed to assess which is the most cost-effective solution. In addition, the influence of wind capacity factor and electricity cost on the levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH) was analyzed to provide an in-depth comparative assessment of the two production scenarios. Even considering the additional transport costs from Argentina to Italy, the scenario with hydrogen production in Patagonia was found to be more convenient than the production in Italy. This is due to the high wind potential in Patagonia, where the average wind capacity factor is about 50% compared to 25% in Italy. The minimum LCOH was obtained considering the storage and transport of hydrogen by means of liquid organic hydrogen carriers, with a final cost of 8.60 €/kgH2 and 11.17 €/kgH2 for the Argentine and Italian production scenarios, respectively. The results of the complete supply chains were analyzed step by step, and the reasons behind the most competitive option elucidated in detail.\n",

      "With the urgent requirement of the utilization of renewable energy (RE) for the decarbonization of energy systems, power transmission via high-voltage direct current (HVDC) lines shows limits in the face of fluctuations of RE generation. This paper addresses the coordinated planning of HVDCs and power-to-hydrogen supply chains (P2HSCs) for RE utilization. First, the lumped cluster model of the large-scale power-to-hydrogen is established based on the derivation of the maximum production points. On this basis, P2HSC is modeled as a constrained power load. Then, a multi-objective multi-stage stochastic planning model of HVDCs and P2HSCs is proposed to fully consider RE fluctuation and uncertainty characteristics. Furthermore, a decomposition algorithm based on the dynamic programming method is designed to solve this problem. Finally, the proposed model and algorithm are applied in real Inner Mongolia-Shandong case studies. The effectiveness and robustness of the proposed model are quantitatively verified. Furthermore, the investment interplay of HVDCs and P2HSCs on the planning timeline and the operational interplay of the two sectors as complementary power loads are verified to create the maximum social benefit in renewable energy systems.\n",

The simulation of the pressurisation in an prismatic pressure vessel showed that the design pressure increased with the ortho concentration: 5.1, 5.7, 7.9 and 11.5 bara for the ortho concentrations of 2%, 10%, 20% and 30%, respectively. This trend caused the loading limit to decrease at higher ortho concentrations, thus critically affecting the LH2 shipping economics. Consequently, the optimal ortho concentration would minimise the total supply chain cost. A sensitivity study was conducted for possible ranges of voyage distance.\n",

      "Hydrogen is a clean fuel which has the potential to drastically decarbonize the energy supply chain. However, hydrogen storage is currently a key challenge; one solution to this problem is hydrogen geo‐storage, with which very large quantities of H2 can be stored economically. Possible target formations are deep coal seams, and coal permeability is a key parameter which determines how fast H2 can be injected and withdrawn again. However, it is well known that gas injection into coal can lead to coal swelling, which drastically reduces permeability. We thus injected H2 gas into a coal core and measured dynamic permeability, while imaging the core via x‐ray micro‐tomography at reservoir conditions. Importantly, no changes in coal cleat morphology or permeability were observed. We conclude that H2 geo‐storage in deep coal seams is feasible from a fundamental petro‐physical perspective; this work thus aids in the large‐scale implementation of a hydrogen economy.

The complete production chains are investigated considering various technologies of production, storage, and subsequent utilization of hydrogen in transportation and electric power generation. Comparative analysis of the economic competitiveness of these chains with each other and with solutions based on the use of alternative fuels has been performed. Potential segments for the commercial application of the technologies and the conditions required have been evaluated. The analysis has established the most promising directions in the development of hydrogen economy. They primarily include the use of hydrogen in the defense industry and power supply of critical facilities, where the energy generation costs are not a determining factor. To be competitive in the civil consumption sectors, such as transportation and the power industry, hydrogen technologies have to become significantly less expensive or to receive the corresponding regulatory support. In many countries, the environmental sustainability of hydrogen production will have great significance. The authors conclude that hydrogen can become one of the fuels of the future; to effect this, however, we will have to tread a difficult path of technological progress under stiff competition with continuously developing alternative power-generation methods.\n",

      "Natural gas based hydrogen production with carbon capture and storage is referred to as blue hydrogen.  Natural gas based hydrogen production with carbon capture and storage is referred to as blue hydrogen . If substantial amounts of CO 2 from natural gas reforming are captured and permanently stored, such hydrogen could be a low-carbon energy carrier. However, recent research raises questions about the effective climate impacts of blue hydrogen from a life cycle perspective. Our analysis sheds light on the relevant issues and provides a balanced perspective on the impacts on climate change associated with blue hydrogen. We show that such impacts may indeed vary over large ranges and depend on only a few key parameters: the methane emission rate of the natural gas supply chain, the CO 2 removal rate at the hydrogen production plant, and the global warming metric applied. State-of-the-art reforming with high CO 2 capture rates combined with natural gas supply featuring low methane emissions does indeed allow for substantial reduction of greenhouse gas emissions compared to both conventional natural gas reforming and direct combustion of natural gas. Under such conditions, blue hydrogen is compatible with low-carbon economies and exhibits climate change impacts at the upper end of the range of those caused by hydrogen production from renewable-based electricity. However, neither current blue nor green hydrogen production pathways render fully “net-zero” hydrogen without additional CO 2 removal.\n",

      "Ammonia synthesis is a topic of high interest in the industry as the market continues to expand and demand increases. The current ammonia production route is very energy and carbon-intensive, relying greatly on natural gas both as feedstock as well as for heat and power generation within the plant. In the present work, a cradle-to-gate environmental assessment of conventional and greener hydrogen production routes integrated with ammonia synthesis is carried out according to ReCIPe impact assessment method. Hydrogen production through conventional steam methane reforming coupled with gas-liquid carbon dioxide absorption by amines and chilled ammonia, electrolysis, and iron-based chemical looping are analysed and compared. Mass and energy balances from process flow modelling are used as inputs for the environmental evaluation using Life Cycle Assessment. The system boundaries considered in this work include: i) main processes: ammonia production, hydrogen production, carbon dioxide separation; ii) upstream processes: nitrogen, natural gas, ilmenite, Methyl-DiEthanol-Amine, chilled ammonia and catalysts supply chains, iii) downstream processes: carbon dioxide compression, transport and storage, degradation/disposal of solvents/oxygen carrier. The results show that natural gas-based ammonia synthesis integrated with chemical looping hydrogen production gives the highest reduction in Global Warming Potential while six out of the nine investigated impact indicators (excluding Global Warming Potential) suffer an increase between 30% and 60%. In the case of hydrogen produced from electrolysis, unless the electricity necessary for electrolysis is obtained from non-fossil sources, it results in the highest overall emissions to air, water and soil.\n",

      "Growing concern about the supply of goods under the COVID pandemic due to border restrictions and community lockdown has made us aware of the limitations of the global supply chain. Fertilizers are pivotal for the growth and welfare of humankind, and there is more than a century of history in industrial technology. Ammonia is the key platform chemical here which can be chemically diversified to all kinds of fertilizers. This article puts a perspective on production technologies that can enable a supply of ammonia locally and on-demand in Australia, for the farmers to produce resilient and self-sustained fertilizers. To assess the validity of such a new business model, multiobjective optimization has to be undergone, and computing is the solution to rank the millions of possible solutions. In this lieu, an economic optimization framework for the Australian ammonia supply chain is presented. The model seeks to address the economic potential of distributed ammonia plants across Australia. Different techniques for hydrogen and related ammonia production such as thermal plasma, nonthermal plasma, and electrolysis (all typifying technology disruption), and mini Haber–Bosch (typifying scale disruption) are benchmarked to the central mega plant on a world-scale using conventional technology, verifying that “Moore’s Law” (Mack, C. A. IEEE Trans. 2011, 24 (2), 202–207) of growing bigger and bigger is not the only path to sustainable agriculture. Results show that ammonia can be produced at $317/ton at a regional scale using thermal plasma hydrogen generation which could be competitive to the conventional production model, if credit in terms of lead time and carbon footprint could be taken into account.\n",

The aim of this study is to perform the exergy analysis of hydrogen production by steam reforming from different biogases and analyze the hydrogen production in many different scenarios, showing that cassava wastewater has great potential for hydrogen production. Four different types of methane concentration were studied: 70.25, 75.5, 80.9, and 97.14%.

      "Offshore renewable energies are proposed to generate green hydrogen through PEM electrolysis. Power-to-gas process can be used to store hydrogen gas in synergy with existing oil/gas exploration companies. Offshore CCS is thereafter used to assist in the production of synthetic natural gas entirely offshore. Offshore renewable energy resources have great potential to contribute to the global energy supply chain; however the LCOE of offshore power is still higher as compared to conventional power generation. With a growing interest in offshore resources and considering the capacity of offshore renewable resources, they are anticipated to contribute a larger share of electric power in the next decade. The existing dispatch of offshore wind electricity through offshore substation and sub-sea cables increases the cost of offshore electricity manifold. The offshore wind electricity can be dispatched by conversion into hydrogen and transportation through existing offshore gas pipeline infrastructure. The study presents a novel idea of performing the methanation process entirely offshore by utilizing CCS in conjunction with electrolysis. A proposal of an artificial island that hosts the complete offshore power-to-gas is also presented. It has been found that the proposed arrangement can handle the offshore generated energy seamlessly and transport it to onshore demand centers through traditional natural gas pipeline infrastructure.\n",

      "This review examines the cost of green ammonia production and intercontinental transport to assess the complete supply chain for energy in a global, decarbonised ammonia economy. It further identifies the major constraints on supply and demand. Green hydrogen is considered a highly promising vector for deep decarbonisation of energy systems and is forecast to represent 20% of global energy use by 2050. In order to secure access to this resource, Japan, Germany and South Korea have announced plans to import hydrogen; other major energy consumers are sure to follow. Ammonia, a promising hydrogen derivative, may enable this energy transport, by densifying hydrogen at relatively low cost using well-understood technologies. This review seeks to describe a global green ammonia import/export market: it identifies benefits and limitations of ammonia relative to other hydrogen carriers, the costs of ammonia production and transport, and the constraints on both supply and demand. We find that green ammonia as an energy vector is likely to be critical to future energy systems, but that gaps remain in the literature. In particular, rigorous analysis of production and transport costs are rarely paired, preventing realistic assessments of the delivered cost of energy, or the selection of optimum import/export partners to minimise the delivered cost of ammonia. Filling these gaps in the literature is a prerequisite to the development of robust hydrogen and ammonia strategies, and to enable the formation of global import and export markets of green fuel.\n",

Comprehensive analysis of natural gas network requires evaluation of different chains of gas flow through various levels based on economical and environmental criteria subject to technical and operational constraints such as feasibility, operability and reliability of different alternatives. To aid decision-making process in the sector of natural gas, a generic optimization-based model has been developed for assessing long term energy issues related to planning and design of natural gas supply systems. The model is capable of identifying optimal investment strategies and build up of new capacities of an integrated gas supply system. Evaluation of the potential of energy conservation and hydrogen production in transmission network are also investigated by three energy recovery technologies: turbo expander, ORC and electrolyzer. The model has then been applied in studying the development of Iranian natural gas network. The results indicate the utilization of produced hydrogen by electrolyzer has considerable impact on minimizing the total cost.

First, the review considers the feasibility and environmental dimensions of different bunker fuels, including liquefied natural gas, hydrogen, and ammonia. Also, the operational viability and optimal conditions for these fuels are examined. Secondly, the review considers the entire supply chain, with an emphasis on how liquefied natural gas exporters can establish synergies across the supply chain to also deliver the end-product required by customers instead of delivering only liquefied natural gas. Finally, measures that can support ship operators to comply with environmental regulations are suggested. The outcomes of this review supports the notion that the demand for alternative fuels will continue to increase as the transportation sector moves towards integrating cleaner fuels to comply with increasing environmental regulations.\n",

      "The objective of this study was to investigate the evolution of hydrogen research and its international scientific collaboration network. From the Scopus database, 58,006 relevant articles, published from 1935 until mid-2018, were retrieved. To review this massive volume of publication records, we took a scientometric network analysis approach and investigated the social network of the publication contents based on keywords co-occurrence as well as international collaboration ties. An interesting observation is that despite publications on hydrogen occurring since 1935, the growth of this research field ignited with the Kyoto Protocol of 1997. The publication profile reveals that more than 93% of the existing records have been published over the last two decades. More recently, the accelerated growth of renewables has further motivated hydrogen research with almost 36,000 academic records having been indexed from 2010 till mid-2018. This accounts for ~62% of the total historical publications on hydrogen. The conventional hydrogen production pathway is fossil fuel-based, involving fossil fuel reforming for synthesis gas generation. The keyword analysis also shows a paradigm shift in hydrogen generation to renewables. While all components of hydrogen supply chain research are now growing, the topic areas of biohydrogen and photocatalysis seem to be growing the fastest. Analysis of international collaboration networks also reveals a strong correlation between the increase of collaboration ties on hydrogen research and the publications. Until the 1970s, only 25 countries had collaborated, while this has reached 108 countries as of 2018, with over 17,500 collaboration ties. The collaborations have also evolved into a substantially more integrated network, with a few strong clusters involving China, the United States, Germany, and Japan. The longitudinal network evolution maps also reveal a shift, over the last two decades, from US-Europe centred technology development-interaction to a world in which Asian economies play substantial roles.\n",

      "Carbon-free transportation is envisaged by means of fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEV) propelled by hydrogen that originates from renewably electricity. However, there is a spatial and temporal gap in the production and demand of hydrogen. Therefore, hydrogen storage and transport remain key challenges for sustainable transportation with FCEVs. In this study, we propose a method for calculating a spatially resolved highway routing model for Germany to transport hydrogen by truck from the 15 production locations (source) to the 9683 fueling stations (sink) required by 2050. We consider herein three different storage modes, namely compressed gaseous hydrogen (CGH2), liquid hydrogen (LH2) and liquid organic hydrogen carriers (LOHC). The model applies Dijkstra’s shortest path algorithm for all available source-sink connections prior to optimizing the supply. By creating a detailed routing result for each source-sink connection, a detour factor is introduced for “first and last mile” transportation. The average detour factor of 1.32 is shown to be necessary for the German highway grid. Thereafter, the related costs, transportation time and travelled distances are calculated and compared for the examined storage modes. The overall transportation cost result for compressed gaseous hydrogen is 2.69 €/kgH2, 0.73 €/kgH2 for liquid hydrogen, and 0.99 €/kgH2 for LOHCs. While liquid hydrogen appears to be the most cost-efficient mode, with the integration of the supply chain costs, compressed gaseous hydrogen is more convenient for minimal source-sink distances, while liquid hydrogen would be suitable for distances greater than 130 km.\n",

Also, ammonia is a combustible gas and can be directly used in power plant, which will also reduce the cost for usage. However, some issues like NOx emission should be solved before installation.

      "To reduce criteria pollutant emissions and greenhouse gases from mobile sources, the use of hydrogen as a transportation fuel is proposed as a new paradigm in combination with fuel cells for vehicle power. The extent to which reductions can and will occur depends on the mix of technologies that constitute the hydrogen supply chain. This paper introduces an analysis and planning methodology for estimating emissions, greenhouse gases, and the energy efficiency of the hydrogen supply chain as a function of the technology mix on a life cycle, well to wheels (WTW) basis. The methodology, referred to as the preferred combination assessment (PCA) model, is demonstrated by assessing an illustrative set of hydrogen infrastructure (generation and distribution) deployment scenarios in California's South Coast Air Basin. Each scenario reflects a select mix of technologies for the years 2015, 2030, and 2060 including (1) the proportion of fossil fuels and renewable energy sources of the hydrogen and (2) the rate of hydrogen fuel cell vehicle adoption. The hydrogen deployment scenarios are compared to the existing paradigm of conventional vehicles and fuels with a goal to reveal and evaluate the efficacy and utility of the PCA methodology. In addition to a demonstration of the methodology, the salient conclusions reached from this first application include the following.•Emissions of criteria pollutants increase or decrease, depending on the hydrogen deployment scenario, when compared to an evolution of the existing paradigm of conventional vehicles and fuels.•For all scenarios, pipeline distribution from a centrally located generation source reduces criteria pollutant emissions when compared to distribution by truck.•With one qualification, greenhouse gas emissions are reduced for the scenarios considered with the extent of reduction increasing in proportion to the renewable sources of hydrogen. When natural gas is utilized as a source for hydrogen, leakage of methane from the U.S. natural gas infrastructure is a significant contributor to the greenhouse gases associated with a hydrogen economy.•For all scenarios considered, the WTW energy efficiency improves whereas the consumption of water (and the associated energy) increases.\n",

An environmental and cost analysis of a metal hydride (MH) compressor and competing technologies (an air booster and a commercial hydrogen compressor), is performed for an application to fuel cell driven forklifts. The MH compressor shows limited environmental impacts only when a source of waste heat is available for hydrogen desorption. In these case, impacts would be similar to a generic compressor, but larger than those generated by an air booster. The equivalent economic cost is 6 € per kg of compressed hydrogen for the MH compressor, which is much higher than for the air booster, but lower than for a generic hydrogen compressor. Technical aspects to be improved for large-scale applications of MH compressors are identified.\n",

Decentralized on-site hydrogen production technology is an effective alternative method that can guarantee the operation of hydrogen refueling stations and has been attracting more and more attention from the public. In this paper, which is based on market data from California, we build a system dynamics model to simulate the feedback mechanism of the effects of public funding on the commercial diffusion of on-site hydrogen production technology. The insights derived from the simulation of our system dynamics model suggest that: (1) moderate public funding can help establish the scale of application of on-site hydrogen production technology in the early stages of market development and also provide buffer time for technology upgrading; (2) the adoption of large on-site hydrogen refueling stations is a feasible approach to shorten the standstill period; and (3) excess levels and periods of subsidies would stagnate the growth of supply and demand. We conclude with a discussion about the relevant policy implications from these findings.\n",

      "Green hydrogen for mobility represents an alternative to conventional fuel to decarbonize the transportation sector. Nevertheless, the thermodynamic properties make the transport and the storage of this energy carrier at standard conditions inefficient. Therefore, this study deploys a georeferenced optimal transport infrastructure for four base case scenarios in France and Germany that differs by production distribution based on wind power potential and demand capacities for the mobility sector at different penetration shares for 2030 and 2050. The restrained transport network to the road infrastructure allows focusing on the optimum combination of trucks operating at different states of aggregations and storage technologies and its impact on the annual cost and hydrogen flow using linear programming. Furthermore, four other scenarios with production cost investigate the impact of upstream supply chain cost, and eight scenarios with daily transport and storage optimization analyse the modeling method sensitivity. The results show that compressed hydrogen gas at a high presser level around 500 bar was, on average, a better option. However, at an early stage of hydrogen fuel penetration, substituting compressed gas at low to medium pressure levels by liquid organic hydrogen carrier minimizes the transport and storage costs. Finally, in France, hydrogen production matches population distribution, in contrast to Germany, which suffers from supply and demand disparity.\n",

      " \n",
      "In the current debates on reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the mobility sector, hydrogen produced via water electrolysis from renewable electricity is commonly regarded to be a sustainable energy carrier with large potential for decarbonisation of the mobility sector. Directly produced at the refueling stations site, hydrogen greenhouse gas emissions are presently defined to be zero in e.g. the Directives of the European Union since emissions arising from the facilities construction are defined to be negligible. In order to check the validity of this assumption with respect to the latest technical developments in hydrogen supply, the present article aims to report the environmental performance of hydrogen being produced and compressed for mobility purposes. To this end, a state-of-the-art hydrogen refueling station (HRS) with an on-site alkaline electrolyser is assessed, which was built and operated in Berlin. Assuming electricity supply from wind energy generation, a life cycle assessment for the complete value chain was carried out where primary data for the build-up of electrolyser and HRS were obtained during decommissioning of the station.The results show that the construction of HRS and on-site electrolyser requires higher material and energy expenditures compared to previous investigations on similar but technically less advanced systems. These expenditures generate a significant footprint in the specific e.g. greenhouse gas emissions if the electrolyser is operated at a reduced load factor as it may be foreseen for grid stabilisation purposes. To ensure a strong reduction of emissions compared to conventional fuels, this load factor should be sufficiently high and should be defined to not fall under a certain threshold in upcoming directives. Besides, excessive use of supplies should be avoided and the refueling station should be operated with renewable electricity to the largest extent.\n",

To investigate this question, this study derives cost functions for the selected pipeline reassignment methods. By applying geospatial hydrogen supply chain modeling, the technical and economic potential of natural gas pipeline reassignment during a hydrogen market introduction is assessed. The results of this study show a technically viable potential of more than 80% of the analyzed representative German pipeline network. By comparing the derived pipeline cost functions, it could be derived that pipeline reassignment can reduce the hydrogen transmission costs by more than 60%. Finally, a countrywide analysis of pipeline availability constraints for the year 2030 shows a cost reduction of the transmission system by 30% in comparison to a newly built hydrogen pipeline system.\n",

      "For many countries, the hydrogen economy offers an operational objective for their long-term energy structure. At the end of the next century, the world will depend on the predominant use of carbon-free and carbon-neutral sources of energy, such as flow energy, energy from modern biomass and safe nuclear energy. According to current expectations, traditional fossil fuels will either be practically exhausted or no longer useful as a result of the greenhouse effect. In both cases, a scarcity motive is at issue. This implies that the direct and indirect costs involved in the use of traditional energy supplies will increase sharply with the passage of time, so that the economic feasibility of the less intensive use of energy and the introduction of alternative energy supply systems will no longer be insurmountable problems. The supply and demand structures of energy will be optimally blended by the use of hydrogen and electricity, an almost ideal combination of secondary energy carriers. With these carriers, practically every centralized or decentralized, environmentally sound energy supply can be permanently maintained, both within and outside of industrialized, metropolitan areas. How the transition to a hydrogen economy will precisely take place is not clear. In general, it is assumed that for many decades to come, the economic development of developing countries will depend on the predominant use of relatively “cheap” fossil energy carriers (coal, petroleum and natural gas), as well as on the accompanying energy supply structures. However, those countries, similar to the wealthy industrial countries, will also have to start using highly capital-intensive and very energy-efficient energy supply systems and energy consumption technologies. This requires innovative strategies that are aimed at compensating developing countries (temporarily) for their lack of purchasing power and knowledge infrastructure. Presumably nowhere in the world will a substantial changeover to hydrogen as an energy carrier possibly be at issue in the first few decades. The costs involved in the hydrogen chain are still too high, and world energy prices are still to low for such a changeover to take place. Attention, however, will focus on drastic energy saving, decarbonization of fossil fuels, substitution to natural gas, the opening up of flow energy, biomass production and the development of inherently safe nuclear energy.\n",

      "This work introduces an efficient tool for the design of sustainable hydrogen supply chains (HSCs), considering both economic and environmental concerns, through an appropriate multi-objective strategy. The original problem, being formulated as a bi-objective mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem, takes into consideration the availability of different energy sources, the installation and operation of hydrogen facilities of different sizes and technologies, and the transportation of hydrogen from production units to storage facilities. The area of study is divided into grids which have a specific hydrogen demand that evolves over time, thus a multi-period model of the HSC is considered. In order to overcome the computational burden associated to the solution of large size instances of the resulting problem, we proposed a solution strategy consisting of a hybrid algorithm. The original problem is reformulated into a bi-level optimization problem: the upper level (discrete problem) consists of finding the optimal location for production plants and storage facilities, whereas the lower level (continuous problem) minimizes their corresponding costs associated to transportation and facility operation. A multi-objective evolutionary algorithm is employed for the solution of the bi-objective upper level, whereas the bi-objective lower level is decomposed using a scalarizing function, which is then solved using a linear programming solver. The proposed methodology is validated through the comparison of the true Pareto fronts given by CPLEX with ε -constraint method, for six increasing size instances. Numerical results prove that the proposed hybrid approach produces an accurate approximation of the Pareto-optimal fronts, more efficiently than the exact solution approach.\n",

      "Increasingly, hydrogen is being promoted as an alternative energy carrier for a sustainable future. Many argue that its use as a transportation fuel in fuel cell vehicles offers a number of attractive advantages over existing energy sources, especially in terms of well-to-wheel greenhouse gas emissions. Following this interest, several of the leading energy companies, like BP, have started investigating strategies for its introduction. The challenge of developing a future commercial hydrogen economy clearly still remains, though: what are the energy efficient, environmentally benign and cost effective pathways to deliver hydrogen to the consumer? Establishing what these “best” pathways may be is not trivial, given that a large number of technological options exist and are still in development for its manufacturing, storage, distribution and dispensing. Cost, operability, reliability, environmental impacts, safety and social implications are all performance measures that should be considered when assessing the different pathways as viable long-term alternatives. To aid this decision-making process, we present a generic optimization-based model for the strategic long-range investment planning and design of future hydrogen supply chains. By utilizing Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) techniques, the model is capable of identifying optimal investment strategies and integrated supply chain configurations from the many alternatives. Realizing also that multiple performance criteria are of interest, the optimization is conducted in terms of both investment and environmental criteria, with the ultimate outcome being a set of optimal trade-off solutions representing conflicting infrastructure pathways. Since many agree that there is no one single template strategy for investing in a hydrogen infrastructure across the globe, emphasis is placed on developing a generic model such that it can be readily applied to different scenarios, geographical regions and case studies. As such, the model supports BP's strategic hydrogen infrastructure planning using high-level optimization programming, and is coined bpIC-H2. The features and capabilities of the model are illustrated through the application to a case study.\n",

      "The substantial expansion of renewable energy sources is creating the foundation to successfully transform the German energy sector (the so-called ‘Energiewende’). A by-product of this development is the corresponding capacity demand for the transportation, distribution and storage of energy. Hydrogen produced by electrolysis offers a promising solution to these challenges, although the willingness to invest in hydrogen technologies requires the identification of competitive and climate-friendly pathways in the long run. Therefore, this paper employs a pathway analysis to investigate the use of renewable hydrogen in the German passenger car transportation sector in terms of varying market penetration scenarios for fuel cell-electric vehicles (FCEVs). The investigation focuses on how an H2 infrastructure can be designed on a national scale with various supply chain networks to establish robust pathways and important technologies, which has not yet been done. Therefore, the study includes all related aspects, from hydrogen production to fueling stations, for a given FCEV market penetration scenario, as well as the CO2 reduction potential that can be achieved for the transport sector. A total of four scenarios are considered, estimating an FCEV market share of 1–75% by the year 2050. This corresponds to an annual production of 0.02–2.88 million tons of hydrogen. The findings show that the most cost-efficient H2 supply (well-to-tank: 6.7–7.5 €/kgH2) can be achieved in high demand scenarios (FCEV market shares of 30% and 75%) through a combination of cavern storage and pipeline transport. For low-demand scenarios, however, technology pathways involving LH2 and LOHC truck transport represent the most cost-efficient options (well-to-tank: 8.2–11.4 €/kgH2).\n",

      "Hydrogen used as an energy carrier can provide an important route to the decarbonization of energy supplies, but realizing this opportunity will require both significantly increased production and transportation capacity. One route to increased transportation capacity is the shipping of liquid hydrogen, but this requires an energy-intensive liquefaction step. Recent study work has shown that the energy required in this process can be reduced through the implementation of new and improved process designs, but since all low-temperature processes are affected by the available heat-sink temperature, local ambient conditions will also have an impact. The objective of this work is to identify how the energy consumption associated with hydrogen liquefaction varies with heat-sink temperature through the optimization of design parameters for a next-generation mixed refrigerant based hydrogen liquefaction process. The results show that energy consumption increases by around 20% across the cooling temperature range 5 to 50 °C. Considering just the range 20 to 30 °C, there is a 5% increase, illustrating the significant impact ambient temperature can have on energy consumption. The implications of this work are that the modelling of different liquified hydrogen based energy supply chains should take the impact of ambient temperature into account.\n",

The rate coefficient is expressible as k1= 1.3 × 1010 exp(–37 600/RT) s–1. A small decrease in rate is caused by an increase in the surface-to-volume ratio of the reaction vessel.

      "Controlled radical polymerization (CRP) has emerged as a spotlight of polymer chemistry in both academic and industrial fields. CRP relies on a reversible dissociation and combination of the carbon–heteroatom bond to construct an activation–deactivation equilibrium, carrying out a linear increase of M n with the conversion. Heteroatoms serve as polymer chain ends after the CRP process, and they reinitiate polymerization to form block polymers and other topological architectures. However, heteroatom chain ends also undermine the stability of polymers under some extreme external conditions, such as heating and ultraviolet (UV) irradiation. Herein, we develop a radical strategy for removing heteroatom chain ends by stoichiometric N-heterocyclic carbene borane (NHC-BH3). NHC-BH3 abstracts a heteroatom and concurrently supplies a hydrogen atom without additional catalysts and hydrogen sources. This strategy is applied for polymers synthesized from various CRP approaches (including atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP), reversible addition–fragmentation transfer (RAFT), nitroxide-mediated polymerization (NMP), and iodine transfer polymerization (ITP)) with a scalable ability (>15 g) in both organic and aqueous conditions. After chain-end removal, the polymers show improved thermal and UV stability.\n",

In this study, an approach of analyzing the implementation effects considering regional characteristics with energy balance simulation model is proposed. As a case study, the potential mitigation of life-cycle greenhouse gas emission by substituting fuel cell vehicles and stationary fuel cell cogeneration systems in households for conventional vehicles and energy supply systems was visualized for two kinds of regions with different classification policies; i.e., prefectures and urban employment areas in Japan. The case study indicated that regional characteristics such as the annual travel distance per car, number of cars, and the power and heat demand strongly affect the implementation effects.

A model of the hydrogen supply chain (HSC) based on MILP formulation (mixed integer linear programming) in a multi-objective, multi-period formulation, implemented via the ε-constraint method to generate the Pareto front, was conducted in a previous work and applied to the Occitania region of France. Three objective functions have been considered, i.e., the levelized hydrogen cost, the global warming potential, and a safety risk index. However, the size of the problem mainly induced by the number of binary variables often leads to difficulties in problem solution. The first innovative part of this work explores the potential of genetic algorithms (GAs) via a variant of the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) to manage multi-objective formulation to produce compromise solutions automatically. The values of the objective functions obtained by the GAs in the mono-objective formulation exhibit the same order of magnitude as those obtained with MILP, and the multi-objective GA yields a Pareto front of better quality with well-distributed compromise solutions. The differences observed between the GA and the MILP approaches can be explained by way of managing the constraints and their different logics. The second innovative contribution is the modelling of demand uncertainty using fuzzy concepts for HSC design. The solutions are compared with the original crisp models based on either MILP or GA, giving more robustness to the proposed approach.\n",

      "Underground hydrogen storage has been recognized as a key technology for storing enormous amounts of hydrogen, thus aiding in the industrial-scale application of a hydrogen economy. However, underground hydrogen storage is only poorly understood, which leads to high project risk. This research thus examined the effect of caprock availability and hydrogen injection rate on hydrogen recovery factor and hydrogen leakage rate to address some fundamental questions related to underground hydrogen storage. A three dimensional heterogeneous reservoir model was developed, and the impact of caprock and hydrogen injected rate on hydrogen underground storage efficiency were analysed with the model. The results indicate that both caprock and injection rate have an important impact on hydrogen leakage, and the quantities of trapped and recovered hydrogen. It is concluded that higher injection rate increases H2 leakage when caprocks are absent. In addition, lower injection rates and caprock availability increases the amount of recovered hydrogen. This work therefore provided fundamental information regarding underground hydrogen storage project assessment, and supports the decarbonisation of the energy supply chain. Cited as:  Mahdi, D.

Here, we present a process intensification strategy for improved LOHC dehydrogenation and an example of clean power generation using solid oxide fuel cells. Four LOHC candidates—ammonia, biphenyl-diphenylmethane eutectic mixture, N-phenylcarbazole, and N-ethylcarbazole—have been compared as stand-alone and integrated systems using comprehensive process simulation. “Temperature cascade” dehydrogenation was shown to increase the energy generated per unit mass (kWh/kg LOHC) by 1.3–2 times in an integrated system compared to stand-alone LOHC systems, thus providing a possibility for a positive impact on a LOHC-based hydrogen supply chain.\n",

The objective of this paper is to discuss the interactions between alternative transport fuels for international applications and Singapore’s energy system as a central hub of global transport. The process chains for the supply of conventional fuels, liquefied natural gas, biofuels, and liquid hydrogen in Singapore are analysed by applying a well-to-tank analysis, following which the energy demand and the associated greenhouse gas emissions are calculated. A sensitivity analysis is performed to assess the individual impacts of various processes. A comparison of process chains for the supply of fuels for marine and aviation purposes shows that conventional energy carriers and liquefied natural gas achieve higher energy efficiencies than biofuels and liquid hydrogen. Alternative fuels reduce greenhouse gas emissions by varying degrees depending on the fuel type. An analysis of interactions with Singapore’s energy system identifies emerging opportunities and challenges for the city-state’s economic system associated with future development of international transport. Although alternative fuels offer the possibility of diversifying Singapore’s energy supply, creating new business opportunities, and increasing Singapore’s impact on fighting climate change, limited resource potentials and higher energy prices set new challenges to secure Singapore’s role as an international trade and transport hub.\n",

Based on the perspectives of the value chain, the study classified these industries into energy supply, conversion, and utilization types. The upstream energy supply function was associated with the supply of energy sources; the midstream conversion function, with the conversion of energy sources into energy forms such as electricity or thermal energy; and the downstream utilization function, with the production of the function(s) required by users through electrical power or thermal energy. From the viewpoints of energy conservation and carbon reduction, this study divided the assessment indexes into five categories: energy supply efficiency, conversion efficiency, utilization efficiency, consumption, and carbon emission. This study first explained the investigation of energy conservation and carbon reduction indexes and then constructed an energy conservation and carbon reduction performance assessment model. Finally, as an example, a fuel cell-powered motorcycle developed by the hydrogen power and fuel cell industry was considered in order to estimate actual energy conservation and carbon reduction performance. Biomass fermentation was used to produce the hydrogen supply. The results indicated that this model could both estimate energy consumption and CO2 emission and analyze major energy conservation and carbon reduction sources for these industries.\n",

      "In this paper, the current energy mix and the power generation infrastructure of Turkey have been analyzed and two different hydrogen based alternative scenarios applied on Burdur TIMES energy model to foresee the economic and environmental results in the 2016–2031 time period. An improved RES was created to illustrate the current energy network of Burdur city and to determine the relationships between energy carriers and the respective technologies, and then this structure is specified by the relevant data, including fuel cell-powered land vehicle technologies integrated into the land transportation demand side. This paper analyses the feasibility of hydrogen as an alternative energy carrier in the fuel mix for electricity generation in Burdur City to achieve sustainable economic growth, to improve the energy security by minimizing respective environmental emissions and indicate the possible implications of the introduction of the hydrogen supply chain and respective fuel cell end-use technologies in a city level energy modelling perspective. Burdur is selected as the target city to implement the designated level of land transport passenger demand by hydrogen technologies; and after implementation of hydrogen cars in 2020; it has been evaluated that only 0.09 PJ of hydrogen car activity prevents a total of 43.44 kT CO2 emission in Burdur, addressing the 8% of the total emission in the base scenario between the analysis time horizon. Finally, hydrogen has been evaluated as a clean, dependable option to diversify the energy mix on the current energy supply system of Burdur.\n",

      "The analysis presents a novel method for evaluating the technology status and cost of metal–organic frameworks for H 2 delivery.   Numerous adsorption-based technologies are emerging as candidates for hydrogen transportation, and yet little is known about their practical viability. As such, new approaches are needed to conduct early validation of emerging hydrogen transportation concepts despite a lack of clear criteria for viable future hydrogen supply chains. In this work, we conduct technoeconomic modeling to quantify cost, performance, and relations between system components for early-stage adsorbent-based hydrogen supply chains. We compare results with the cost and performance of high pressure compressed gas and liquid hydrogen trucks in the same applications. Using available experimental adsorption data, we simulate the gravimetric performance of tube trailer trucks packed with metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) operated at 100 bar and 77 or 200 K. We also extrapolated available experimental data to study a third scenario where tube trailer trucks are operated at ambient temperature and 250 bar. Models developed for these conditions represent feasible operation scenarios where pressurization or cooling costs can be reduced relative to compressed or liquid hydrogen truck systems. Results suggest that the levelized cost of long-distance transmission, including a gas terminal and MOF-based truck fleet, ranges from $7.3 to $29.0 per kg H 2 . The levelized cost of transmission using compressed hydrogen gas trucks at 350 and 500 bar and liquid hydrogen trucks is substantially lower, at $1.8, $1.7 and $3.1 per kg H 2 , respectively. In a short-distance urban distribution application, the MOF-based truck fleet, gas terminal, and refueling stations have a levelized cost between $11.8 and $40.0 per kg H 2 , which is also more expensive than distribution in the case of the 350 bar, 500 bar and liquid hydrogen trucks, which have levelized costs of $4.7, $4.1 and $3.9 per kg H 2 , respectively. Key opportunities identified for lowering costs are: increasing the hydrogen capacity of the tube system by developing new MOFs with higher volumetric deliverable capacities, flexible allowable daily deliveries per refueling station, increasing the cycling stability of the MOF, and driverless trucks.\n",

      "In the past decades, H2 has attracted significant attention as a potentially low, zero, or negative-emissions fuel depending on how it is produced. However, how H2 will evolve in terms of its production, demand, and transport is not very clear. To help fill this gap, we developed a Python-based tool called the Hydrogen Economy Assessment & Resource Tool (HEART), specifically focused on the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) region. The tool consists of three parts: a user-friendly GUI, a default database consisting of costs and emissions for various supply/demand pathways, and an analysis and optimization engine. Users can use the default data and/or user inputs to run case studies for insightful results. The analysis and optimization engine can carry out techno-enviro-economic analysis for H2 production and H2 transport, project H2 demand, and carry out the optimization and planning of H2 supply chain over a long-term period. In this paper, we introduce the framework of HEART, the workflow of various projects, and show the capabilities and strengths of HEART through a case study. The case study indicates the tool can provides many useful results, like the landed cost and carbon footprint of H2. Most importantly, by using HEART, H2 supply chain pathways to meet projected demand can be obtained and optimized for total cost or total emissions.\n",

      " \n",
      "This study aimed to identify the impact of achieving the 1.5 °C target on the petroleum supply chain in Japan, and discuss the feasibility and challenges of decarbonization. First, a national material flow was established for the petroleum supply chain in Japan, including processes for crude petroleum refining, petroleum product manufacturing, plastic resin and product manufacturing, and by-product manufacturing. In particular, by-product manufacturing processes, such as hydrogen, gaseous carbon dioxide, and sulfur, were selected because they are utilized in other industries. Next, the outlook for the production of plastic resin, hydrogen, dry ice produced from carbon dioxide gas, and sulfur until 2050 was estimated for reducing petroleum consumption required to achieve the 1.5 °C target. As a result, national petroleum treatment is expected to reduce from 177,048.00 thousand kl in 2019 to 126,643.00 thousand kl in 2030 if the reduction in petroleum consumption is established. Along with this decrease, plastic resin production is expected to decrease from 10,500.00 thousand ton in 2019 to 7511.00 thousand ton by 2030. Conversely, the plastic market is expected to grow steadily, and the estimated plastic resin production in 2030 is expected to be 20,079.00 thousand ton. This result indicates that there is a large output gap between plastic supply and demand. To mitigate this gap, strongly promoting the recycling of waste plastics and making the price competitiveness of biomass plastics equal to that of petroleum-derived plastics are necessary.\n",

      "Many transportation environmental life cycle analyses neglect the contribution of the energy supply infrastructures. In alternative light duty vehicle technologies, it has been shown through case studies that this can be a relevant factor. However, no model that can generalise the evaluation of energy and emissions from construction, maintenance and decommissioning of such infrastructure to analyse different scenarios currently exists. A model is proposed, focussing on electricity and on hydrogen supply through centralised steam methane reforming (H2(a)) and on-site electrolysis (H2(b)). The model outputs are in gCO2eq/MJ and MJeq/MJ of the final energy. Model main inputs are the region's electricity mix, the annual distance driven, supply chain losses and the number of vehicles per station or chargers. The evaluation of the number of vehicles served per each charger/station as a function of annual distance driven is presented. The uncertainty is estimated by using the pedigree matrix, impact uncertainty and literature estimates. The model shows consistency in the results and uncertainty range. Charging policies that minimise the electricity infrastructure burden should incentivise approximately 37% of normal charging. H2(a) pipeline lifetime should be extended. Efforts in the electrolyser should be undertaken to approximate the ratio of vehicles per station with a conventional one.\n",

      "For the introduction of a hydrogen economy one of the most relevant questions is: what are the suitable feedstocks and production technologies for hydrogen, which is a secondary energy carrier, taking into account the manifold objectives of hydrogen introduction: the cost-effective substitution of oil, increasing the security of energy supply, and reducing CO2 and other emissions? This study focuses on constructing a hydrogen infrastructure in Europe by 2030. Several hydrogen technologies and their integration into an infrastructure system, including the production, transport and distribution of hydrogen, are analysed on the basis of energy chain calculations and expert judgements and consistent scenarios are developed. It can be shown that under economic and CO2-reduction objectives, the steam reforming of gas, followed by coal gasification and, to a limited extent, the electrolysis of electricity from renewable energy carriers are the most promising hydrogen production options in this first phase for developing a hydrogen infrastructure. These options result in a significant level of CO2-reduction. However, the total cost of the infrastructure will account for 0.3% of EU-25 GDP in 2030. This shows the extent of the challenge involved in constructing a hydrogen infrastructure.\n",

      "This paper presents an optimization modeling approach to support strategic planning for designing hydrogen supply chain (HSC) networks. The energy source for hydrogen production is proposed to be electricity generated at Mexican sugar factories. This study considers the utilization of existing infrastructure in strategic areas of the country, which brings several advantages in terms of possible solutions. This study aims to evaluate the economic and environmental implications of using biomass wastes for energy generation, and its integration to the national energy grid, where the problem is addressed as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP), adopting maximization of annual profit, and minimization of greenhouse gas emissions as optimization criteria. Input data is provided by sugar companies and the national transport and energy information platform, and were represented by probability distributions to consider variability in key parameters. Independent solutions show similarities in terms of resource utilization, while also significant differences regarding economic and environmental indicators. Multi-objective optimization was performed by a genetic algorithm (GA). The optimal HSC network configuration is selected using a multi-criteria decision technique, i.e., TOPSIS. An uncertainty analysis is performed, and main economic indicators are estimated by investment assessment. Main results show the trade-off interactions between the HSC elements and optimization criteria. The average internal rate of return (IRR) is estimated to be 21.5% and average payback period is 5.02 years.\n",

      " \n",
      "The controversial and highly emotional discussion about biofuels in recent years has shown that greenhouse gas2 (GHG) emissions can only be evaluated in an acceptable way by carrying out a full life cycle assessment (LCA) taking the overall life cycle including all necessary pre-chains into consideration. Against this background, the goal of this paper is it to analyse the overall life cycle of a hydrogen production and provision. A state of the art hydrogen refuelling station in Hamburg/Germany opened in February 2012 is therefore taken into consideration. Here at least 50% hydrogen from renewable sources of energy is produced on-site by water electrolysis based on surplus electricity from wind (mainly offshore wind parks) and water. The remaining other 50% of hydrogen to be sold by this station mainly to hydrogen-fuelled buses is provided by trucks from a large-scale production plant where hydrogen is produced from methane or glycerol as a by-product of the biodiesel production. These two pathways are compared within the following explanations with hydrogen production from biomass and from coal. The results show that – with the goal of reducing GHG emissions on a life cycle perspective – hydrogen production based on a water electrolysis fed by electricity from the German electricity mix should be avoided. Steam methane reforming is more promising in terms of GHG reduction but it is still based on a finite fossil fuel. For a climatic sound provision of hydrogen as a fuel electricity from renewable sources of energy like wind or biomass should be used.\n",

      " \n",
      "Hydrogen could play a key role in future energy systems by enabling the storage of excess electricity from renewable power sources, like solar and wind, and fueling emission-free fuel cell electric vehicles. Nevertheless, the temporal and spatial gap between the fluctuating production in electrolysis plants and the demand at fueling stations necessitates the construction of infrastructures. Different technologies are available for storing and transporting hydrogen in its gaseous or liquid states, or even via liquid organic hydrogen carriers. To select and compare these different infrastructure options on a nationwide scale in Germany for an energy system 2050, we carried out an infrastructure assessment with spatial resolution to analyze the resulting costs and CO2 emissions, as well as the primary energy demand. To do so, methods for designing a spatially-resolved infrastructure are presented. In particular, the setup of a transmission pipeline with gaseous trailer distribution has not been well represented and investigated in the literature so far. The results show that salt caverns, as well as transmission pipelines, are key technologies for future hydrogen infrastructure systems. The distribution should be handled for low penetration of fuel cell vehicles rates with gaseous compressed trailers and replaced by distribution pipelines in areas with high fueling station densities. This ensures the cost-effective supply during the transition to higher fuel cell vehicle fleets.\n",

      " \n",
      "The world-wide sustainability implications of transport technologies remain unclear because their assessment often relies on metrics that are hard to interpret from a global perspective. To contribute to filling this gap, here we apply the concept of planetary boundaries (PBs), i.e., a set of biophysical limits critical for operating the planet safely, to address the optimal design of sustainable fuel supply chains (SCs) focusing on hydrogen for vehicle use. By incorporating PBs into a mixed-integer linear programming model (MILP), we identify SC configurations that satisfy a given transport demand while minimising the PBs transgression level, i.e., while reducing the risk of surpassing the ecological capacity of the Earth. On applying this methodology to the UK, we find that the current fossil-based sector is unsustainable as it transgresses the energy imbalance, CO2 concentration, and ocean acidification PBs heavily, i.e., five to 55-fold depending on the downscale principle. The move to hydrogen would help to reduce current transgression levels substantially, i.e., reductions of 9–86% depending on the case. However, it would be insufficient to operate entirely within all the PBs concurrently. The minimum impact SCs would produce hydrogen via water electrolysis powered by wind and nuclear energy and store it in compressed form followed by distribution via rail, which would require as much as 37TWh of electricity per year. Our work unfolds new avenues for the incorporation of PBs in the assessment and optimisation of energy systems to arrive at sustainable solutions that are entirely consistent with the carrying capacity of the planet.\n",

      "The use of low-carbon hydrogen is being considered to help decarbonize several jurisdictions around the world. There may be opportunities for energy-exporting countries to supply energy-importing countries with a secure source of low-carbon hydrogen. The study objective is to assess the delivered cost of gaseous hydrogen export from Canada (a fossil-resource rich country) to the Asia-Pacific, Europe, and inland destinations in North America. There is a data gap on the feasibility of inter-continental export of hydrogen from an energy-producing jurisdiction to energy-consuming jurisdictions. This study is aimed at addressing this gap and includes an assessment of opportunities across the Pacific Ocean and the Atlantic Ocean, based on fundamental engineering-based models. Techno-economics were used to determine the delivered cost of hydrogen to these destinations. The modelling considers energy, material, and capacity-sizing requirements for a five-stage supply chain comprising hydrogen production with carbon capture and storage, hydrogen pipeline transportation, liquefaction, shipping, and regasification at the destinations. The results show that the delivered cost of hydrogen to inland destinations in North America is between CAD$4.81/kg and CAD$6.03/kg, to the Asia-Pacific from CAD$6.65/kg to CAD$6.99/kg, and at least CAD$8.14/kg for exports to Europe. Delivering hydrogen by blending in existing long-distance natural gas pipelines reduced the delivered cost to inland destinations by 17%. Exporting ammonia to the Asia-Pacific provides cost savings of 28% compared to shipping liquified hydrogen. The developed information may be helpful to policymakers in government and the industry in making informed decisions about international trade of low-carbon hydrogen in both energy-exporting and energy-importing jurisdictions, globally.\n",

Most existing green hydrogen initiatives are in Europe. In anticipation of a future market for green hydrogen, international standards are starting to be discussed by national and international standardisation organisations and policy makers. A range of approaches have been taken to defining green hydrogen and guarantees of origin. These vary on whether green hydrogen must be produced from renewable energy, on the boundaries of the carbon accounting system, the emission thresholds at which hydrogen is considered green, and on which feedstocks and production technologies are included in the scheme. Decisions on these factors are often influenced by other national and international standards, and the legal framework in which the green hydrogen supply chain operates.\n",

      "Based on Japan’s nationally determined contributions submitted to the United Nations in 2016, Japan plans to cut its GHG emissions by 26% in FY2030 compared to FY2013 levels through reductions in domestic GHG emissions and absorption. To do so, it is necessary to cut 310 million tons of CO₂ in total, and we need to pay special attention to the power generation sector since it accounts currently for 40% of total CO₂ emissions. In addition, Japan’s Plan for Global Warming Countermeasures seeks to cut GHG emissions by 80% over the long term through 2050 by taking maximum advantage of innovations, including the development and diffusion of innovative technologies outlined in the Paris Agreement.  Under these circumstances, Japanese government considers that realization of hydrogen society is one of solution of reduction of GHG. To promote the widespread use of hydrogen and become a world-leading hydrogen-based society, the Japanese government formulated the Basic Hydrogen Strategy in December 2017. The strategy outlines the future visions for the year 2050, and also serves as an action plan through the year 2030. The strategy sets a goal for Japan to reduce the cost of hydrogen to the same level as those for conventional energy sources. The strategy also aims to develop international hydrogen supply chains and domestic power-to-gas (P2G) technology so that renewable hydrogen supplies can meet an annual demand of approximately 300,000 tons of hydrogen at a cost of 30 yen/Nm 3 by 2030, with the cost expected to drop as low as 20 yen/Nm³ for the years that follow. The target numbers of hydrogen-related applications to be produced or installed, such as fuel cell vehicles (FCV), fuel cell buses, hydrogen refueling stations (HRS), and stationary fuel cells, are indicated in the strategy. Following this strategy, on March 12, 2019, the Council for a Strategy for Hydrogen and Fuel Cells renewed the existing Strategic Roadmap for Hydrogen and Fuel Cell in order to achieve the goals set forth in the Basic Hydrogen Strategy. The renewed roadmap defines: (i) new targets on specifications of basic technologies and a breakdown of costs; (ii) necessary measures for achieving these goals; and (iii) the method by which Japan will convene a working group consisting of experts to review the status of implementation in each area stipulated by the roadmap.  Based on this, NEDO, as one of largest public agencies promoting national R&D projects in Japan, conducts various projects as followings; Fuel Cells: Until FY2019, NEDO implemented 2 projects. In the case of PEFC field, the main objective of the project is reducing usage costs for transportation means such as FCV, since PEFCs for such use need the highest level of reliability for use in commercial vehicles. Through activation of a catalysis in platinum group metals, the target value per kW of a cell is from 0.03 to 0.1 g PGM/kW, as an example. As to SOFC, the target of the efficiency in the project is 65% with mono-generation use and a durability of 90,000 h. In order to clarify the technical issues for high-efficiency and durable SOFC cell-stacks or create a concept for high-efficiency cell-stacks, the project concentrates on the evaluation of the durability of stacks, clarification of degradation mechanisms, the development of simulation technique, and the development of high-durability cells. From FY2020, NEDO started brand new project entitled as “Collaborative Industry-Academia-Government R&D Project for Solving Common Challenges toward Dramatically Expanded Use of Fuel Cells” which investigate the basic mechanism of common difficulties for commercialization of fuel cells among industry. Hydrogen Refueling Station (HRS): A regulatory reform of FCV/HRS is one approach for reducing CAPEX/OPEX. Unstaffed operation with remote monitoring is another solution; however, a risk assessment on HRS needs to be considered deeply as well. Developing low-cost equipment such as polymer materials for dispensers and electrochemical compressors is an important target as well. Large-Scale Supply Chain: To develop a large-scale supply chain, NEDO has embarked on technological development to convert unused energy from overseas into hydrogen and transport it long distance to Japan as well. NEDO selected two types of hydrogen carriers: one is liquid hydrogen from Australia; and the other is organic chemical hydrides from Brunei. Power-To-Gas (P2G): NEDO conducts several P2G projects. One example is the world's largest-scale P2G demonstration with 10-MW electrolysis in Fukushima Prefecture called “Fukushima Hydrogen Energy Research Field (FH2R)”.\n",

      " \n",
      "Hydrogen is considered to be the future optimal energy carrier, and is expected to contribute to the growth of the world's economy by facilitating a stable supply of energy. The ability of green algae to produce hydrogen was discovered 74 years ago. Since then, several attempts were made, to increase hydrogen production yields, sulfur starvation being the best known. The main concern during these attempts was that the achievable increase in yield was not sustainable. In this contribution, potassium deficiency is presented as a biochemical/bioenergetic switch for a sustained high yield of hydrogen production via the photosynthetic apparatus. Potassium can partially be replaced by sodium in the majority of biochemical processes and as a result the system remains functional. However, sodium cannot replace potassium in the conversion of glucose to starch. This fact significantly increased the yield of hydrogen production through the Photosystem II independent pathway, since electrons originating from the metabolism of glucose are used in the continuous donation to the plastoquinone-pool of the photosynthetic electron chain. Additionally, PSII inactivation (and therefore the inhibition of O2-production), the further synthesis and over activation of Photosystem I and plastidic hydrogenase, generated a sustained increase in hydrogen production, mainly through the PSII-independent pathway. The self regulation of these multistage processes in hermitically closed static systems of Scenedesmus obliquus cultivation, permitted the establishment of anoxic conditions and the continuous electron supply to highly activated hydrogenase, resulting in the sustained high yield hydrogen production and paving the way for future usage in an industrial scale application.\n",

      "Solar hydrogen production coupled with a fuel cell stack would appear to be an alternative method to produce environmentally friendly energy and could overcome the intermittent nature of the power sources. In particular, production of hydrogen in a solar photocatalytic reactor using wastewater offers a promising way forward. A system combining photoreactors for hydrogen production by photocatalytic methanol dehydrogenation and a proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) was used to directly convert solar irradiance into electricity. The photoreactor system of about 364cm2 contains 1.2L of pure methanol and a TiO2 slurry of 1g/L. The fuel cell presents a 25cm2 active area filled at the anode by photocatalytic hydrogen and at the cathode by oxygen from the air in a self-breathing mode. Fuel cell performances have been followed at constant voltage. Without any purification of hydrogen and without any optimization of the design, the system successfully provides an electric power density of 1mWcm−2 of photoreactor optical surface area exposed to the sunlight.\n",

      "This work presents a methodological design framework for Hydrogen and Methane Supply Chains (HMSC). An innovative approach is to focus on Power-to-Hydrogen (PtH) and Power-to-Methane (PtM) concepts, and their interactions with other technologies, and energy carriers (i.e., Steam Methane Reforming – SMR, and natural gas). The overall objective of this work is to perform single objective and multi-objective optimizations for HMSC design to provide effective support for deployment scenarios. The methodological framework developed is based on a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) approach with augmented ε-constraint implemented in the GAMS environment according to a multi-period approach (2035-2050). Several available energy sources (wind, PV, hydro, national power grid, and natural gas) for hydrogen production through electrolysis and SMR are included. Carbon dioxide sources stem mainly from methanization and gasification processes, which are used to produce methane through methanation. The objective to be minimised in the single optimization approach is the total annual cost considering the externality of greenhouse gas emissions through the carbon price for the whole HMSC over the entire period studied. The multi-objective optimization includes as objectives the total annual cost, greenhouse gas emissions, and the total methane production from methanation. The Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE), and the greenhouse gas emissions for each energy carrier are also computed. The results show that renewable hydrogen from PtG can be competitive with SMR through the implementation of carbon prices below 0.27 €/kgCO2. In the case of synthetic methane, the available resources can meet the demand through PtG, and even if synthetic methane for natural gas network injection is thus far from competitive with natural gas, power-to-gas technologies have the potential to decarbonize the fossil economy and achieve a circular economy through CO2 recovery.\n",

      "Fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEV) are emerging as one of the prominent zero emission vehicle technologies. This study follows a deterministic modeling approach to project two scenarios of FCEV adoption and the resulting hydrogen demand (low and high) up to 2050 in California, using a transportation transition model. The study then estimates the number of hydrogen production and refueling facilities required to meet demand. The impact of system scale-up and learning rates on hydrogen price is evaluated using standalone supply chain models: H2A, HDSAM, HRSAM and HDRSAM. A sensitivity analysis explores key factors that affect hydrogen prices. In the high scenario, light and heavy-duty fuel cell vehicle stocks reach 12.5 million and 1 million by 2050, respectively. The resulting annual hydrogen demand is 3.9 billion kg, making hydrogen the dominant transportation fuel. Satisfying such high future demands will require rapid increases in infrastructure investments starting now, but especially after 2030 when there is an exponential increase in the number of production plants and refueling stations. In the long term, electrolytic hydrogen delivered using dedicated hydrogen pipelines to larger stations offers substantial cost savings. Feedstock prices, size of the hydrogen market and station utilization are the prominent parameters that affect hydrogen price.\n",

      " \n",
      "The dehydrogenation and dewaxing of hydrocarbons of middle-distillate fractions, which proceed in the hydrogen medium, are of great importance in the petrochemical and oil refining industries. They increase oil refining depth and allow producing gasoline, kerosene, and diesel fractions used in the production of hydrocarbon fuels, polymer materials, synthetic detergents, rubbers, etc. Herewith, in the process of dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons of middle distillate fractions (C9–C14) hydrogen is formed in the reactions between hydrocarbons, and the excess of hydrogen slows the target reaction of olefin formation and causes the shift of thermodynamic equilibrium to the initial substances. Meanwhile, in the process of hydrodewaxing of hydrocarbons of middle distillate fractions (C5–C27), conversely, hydrogen is a required reagent in the target reaction of hydrocracking of long-chain paraffins, which ensures required feedstock conversion for production of low-freezing diesel fuels. Therefore, in this study we suggest the approach of intensification of the processes of dehydrogenation and dewaxing of middle distillate fractions by means of redistribution of hydrogen between the two units on the base of the influence of hydrogen on the hydrocarbon transformations using mathematical models. In this study we found that with increasing the temperature from 470 °C to 490 °C and decreasing the hydrogen/feedstock molar ratio in the range of 8.5/1.0 to 6.0/1.0 in the dehydrogenation reactor, the production of olefins increased by 1.45–1.55%wt, which makes it possible to reduce hydrogen consumption by 25,000 Nm3/h. Involvement of this additionally available hydrogen in the amount from 10,000 to 50,000 Nm3/h in the dewaxing reactor allows increasing the depth of hydrocracking of long-chain paraffins of middle distillate fractions, and, consequently improving low-temperature properties of produced diesel fraction. In such a way cloud temperature and freezing temperature of produced diesel fraction decrease by 1–4 °C and 10–25 °C (at the temperature of 300 °C and 340 °C respectively). However, when the molar ratio hydrogen/hydrocarbons decreases from 8.5/1.0 to 6.0/1.0 the yield of side products in the dehydrogenation reactor increases: the yield of diolefins increases by 0.1–0.15%wt, the yield of coke increases by 0.07–0.18%wt depending on the feedstock composition, which is due to decrease in the content of hydrogen, which hydrogenates intermediate products of condensation (the coke of amorphous structure). This effect can be compensated by additional water supply in the dehydrogenation reactor, which oxidizes the intermediate products of condensation, preventing catalyst deactivation by coke. The calculations with the use of the model showed that at the supply of water by increasing portions simultaneously with temperature rise, the content of coke on the catalyst by the end of the production cycle comprises 1.25–1.56%wt depending on the feedstock composition, which is by 0.3–0.6%wt lower that in the regime without water supply.\n",

While many governments and private companies are putting significant resources on the development of hydrogen technologies, there still remains a high number of unsolved issues, including technical challenges, economic and geopolitical implications. The hydrogen supply chain includes a large number of steps, resulting in additional energy losses, and while much focus is put on hydrogen generation costs, its transport and storage should not be neglected. A low-carbon hydrogen economy offers promising opportunities not only to fight climate change, but also to enhance energy security and develop local industries in many countries. However, to face the huge challenges of a transition towards a zero-carbon energy system, all available technologies should be allowed to contribute based on measurable indicators, which require a strong international consensus based on transparent standards and targets.\n",

      "Abstract                   The hourly operation of Thermal Hydrogen electricity markets is modelled. The economic values for all applicable chemical commodities are quantified (syngas, ammonia, methanol and oxygen) and an hourly electricity model is constructed to mimic the dispatch of key technologies: bi-directional power plants, dual-fuel heating systems and plug-in fuel-cell hybrid electric vehicles. The operation of key technologies determines hourly electricity prices and an optimization model adjusts the capacity to minimize electricity prices yet allow all generators to recover costs. We examine 12 cost scenarios for renewables, nuclear and natural gas; the results demonstrate emissions-free, ‘energy-only’ electricity markets whose supply is largely dominated by renewables. The economic outcome is made possible in part by seizing the full supply-chain value from electrolysis (both hydrogen and oxygen), which allows an increased willingness to pay for (renewable) electricity. The wholesale electricity prices average $25–$45/MWh, or just slightly higher than the assumed levelized cost of renewable energy. This implies very competitive electricity prices, particularly given the lack of need for ‘scarcity’ pricing, capacity markets, dedicated electricity storage or underutilized electric transmission and distribution capacity.\n",

Thus the Equilibrium Potential “EP” cannot be based on the overall molecular reaction 2H2 + O2 => 2H2O yielding an EP of 1.23 V, but another reactions must be considered. Hydrogen radicals are formed by platinum inside the anode chamber. Radicals reappearing at the cathode either recombine to hydrogen molecules or split oxygen molecules and form hydroxyl radicals. Platinum is needed at the cathode to secure a steady supply of hydrogen radicals. Water is obtained by chemical oxidation of hydroxyl radicals. Two EPs are obtained for hydrogen recombination (measurable) and hydrogen partial oxidation (virtual). Also, two polarity change steps must be considered in the EP equation. With these modifications an excellent agreement between theory and experiment is obtained.\n",

      "In order to examine the variation in marine and terrigenous sources of the organic matter during the last 15,000 Cal. yr BP, hydrogen index values, C/N ratios, and specific biomolecules (short- and long-chain n-alkanes, short-chain fatty acids, sterols, alkenones, and pigments) were determined in three sediment cores from the Laptev Sea continental margin. The results show that the interpretation of the biomarker data is much more complicated and less definitive in comparison to similar data sets from low-latitude open-ocean environments. This is mainly caused by the complexity of the Arctic Ocean system, which is characterized by a high seasonality of sea-ice cover and primary productivity, sea-ice sediment transport and a high fluvial supply of freshwater (aquatic) organic matter. A combination of organic geochemical, organic petrographic and micropaleontological data may yield to a more precise identification of organic-carbon sources for these complex systems. On the Laptev Sea shelf (cores KD9502-14 and PS2725-5), terrigenous organic-carbon input controlled by river discharge seems to be predominant during the last about 10,000 Cal. yr BP. Maximum supply of terrigenous organic carbon was reached in the Early Holocene (i.e., about 9000–10,000 Cal. yr BP). Further offshore at the upper continental slope (core PS2458-4), a major change in organic-composition occurred near 10,000 Cal. yr BP. During this period hydrogen indices as well as the amounts of short-chain n-alkanes, short-chain fatty acids, dinosterol and brassicasterol significantly increased, indicating increased relative proportions of marine organic matter preserved in the later time interval.\n",

Multiple energy vectors including electricity, gas, hydrogen and heat were integrated within the modelling framework. The model was utilised for a study of the Oxford-Cambridge arc region. The study assessed how different energy supply strategies, from electrification of heat to use of ‘green’ gases or local heat networks, could affordably reduce carbon emissions from the Oxford-Cambridge arc region energy system whilst considering constraints from the national system. The modelling process generated a diverse range of options for energy supplies, the choice of supply networks and end use technologies. The analysis illustrated the cost effectiveness and emission reduction potential of electrification of heat despite the requirement for additional network and supply capacity.

With appropriate coordination across the energy supply chain, near-term investments can be used to support scale-up of wider efforts to decarbonize the transportation sector and electric grid.

      "Hydrogen is expected to play a role in the future low‐carbon economy as an energy carrier, but its market penetration remains to be seen. Much of the existing literature generally focuses on comparison of marginal production costs and prices to make rather optimistic projections. This study argues that such analysis is myopic as important barriers are ignored. Following Porter’s five‐force approach, we methodologically identify the economic market forces that shape the development of hydrogen markets, and discuss key obstacles in the supply chain. Using evidence of available hydrogen technologies and costs, the distribution network is identified as a major fixed‐investment barrier to market entry, but it is argued that much of it could be overcome if natural gas infrastructure and technology is shared with the hydrogen sector. Natural gas, in turn, is projected to function as a transition fuel under current carbon emissions targets. This study finds that policy costs needed to promote hydrogen to achieve environmental goals can be substantially reduced if government and private investment decisions strategically focus on synergies with natural gas. The possible formulation of such policies is discussed using Australia’s hydrogen industry as a case study.\n",

      "Hydrogen produced using fossil fuel feedstocks causes greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, even when carbon capture and storage (CCS) is used. By contrast, hydrogen produced using electrolysis and zero-emissions electricity does not create GHG emissions. Several countries advocating the use of ‘clean’ hydrogen put both technologies in the same category. Recent studies and strategies have compared these technologies, typically assuming high carbon capture rates, but have not assessed the impact of fugitive emissions and lower capture rates on total emissions and costs. We find that emissions from gas or coal based hydrogen production systems could be substantial even with CCS, and the cost of CCS is higher than often assumed. Carbon avoidance costs for high capture rates are notable. Carbon prices of $22–46/tCO2e would be required to make hydrogen from fossil fuels with CCS competitive with hydrogen produced from fossil fuels without CCS. At the same time there are indications that electrolysis with renewable energy could become cheaper than fossil fuel with CCS options, possibly in the near-term future. Establishing hydrogen supply chains on the basis of fossil fuels, as many national strategies foresee, may be incompatible with decarbonisation objectives and raise the risk of stranded assets.\n",

      "SYNOPSIS.Mitochondrial ATP production is influenced by many factors, including the adenylate status of the cell, the supply of reducing equivalents to the electron transport chain, the supply of oxygen to cytochrome oxidase, and the demand for ATP to do cellular work. Hydrogen sulfide, which is naturally produced in marine sediments, is a poison of aerobic ATP production mainly because it inhibits cytochrome oxidase in the electron transport chain. However, most animals from high sulfide environments exhibit aerobic respiration, and may avoid sulfide poisoning with detoxification reactions that may be useful sources of energy. Sulfide stimulates ADP phosphorylation in mitochondria isolated from gills of Solemya reidi, a sulfide-oxidizing symbiont-harboring bivalve, and a P/O ratio near unity indicates that electrons from sulfide enter the electron transport chain at the level of cytochrome c. Current investigations into the effects of sulfide on oxygen consumption rate, ATP level, cytochrome reduction state and ciliary beat frequency of symbiont-free gills of the mussels Geukensia demissa and Mytilus edulis indicate that animals from high sulfide environments may gain sufficient energy from sulfide oxidation to support cellular work.\n",

      " \n",
      "The distribution of hydrogen in liquid state has several advantages because of its higher volumetric density compared to compressed hydrogen gas. The demand for liquid hydrogen (LH2), particularly driven by clean fuel cell applications, is expected to rise in the near future. Large-scale hydrogen liquefaction plants will play a major role within the hydrogen supply chain. The barriers of built hydrogen liquefiers is the low exergy efficiency and the high specific liquefaction costs. Exergy efficiency improvements, however, are limited by economic viability. The focus of this paper is to present a roadmap for the scale-up of hydrogen liquefaction technology, from state-of-the-art plants to newly developed large-scale liquefaction processes. The work is aimed at reducing the specific liquefaction costs by finding an optimal trade-off between capital costs and operating costs. To this end, two developed hydrogen liquefaction processes were optimized for specific energy consumption and specific liquefaction costs, showing the potential to reduce the specific liquefaction costs by 67% for a 100 tpd LH2 plant compared to a conventional 5 tpd LH2 plant while achieving a specific energy consumption between 5.9 and 6.6 kWh per kg LH2 with technology that is or will be available within 5 years. The results make liquid hydrogen a viable distribution route for hydrogen for mobility.\n",

      "10.1016/j.ijhydene.2018.08.111\n",
      " \n",
      "Three alternative transport options for hydrogen generated from excess renewable power to a refinery of different scales are compared to the reference case by means of hydrogen production cost, overall efficiency, and CO2 emissions. The hydrogen is transported by a) the natural gas grid and reclaimed by the existing steam reformer, b) an own pipeline and c) hydrogen trailers. The analysis is applied to the city of Hamburg, Germany, for two scenarios of installed renewable energy capacities. The annual course of excess renewable power is modeled in a coupled system approach and the replaceable hydrogen mass flow rate is determined using measurement data from an existing refinery. Dynamic simulations are performed using an open-source Modelica® library. It is found that in all three alternative hydrogen supply chains CO2 emissions can be reduced and costs are increased compared to the reference case. Transporting hydrogen via the natural gas grid is the least efficient but achieves the highest emission reduction and is the most economical alternative for small to medium amounts of hydrogen. Using a hydrogen pipeline is the most efficient option and slightly cheaper for large amounts than employing the natural gas grid. Transporting hydrogen by trailers is not economical for single consumers and realizes the lowest CO2 reductions.\n",

The Chinese government highly values the hydrogen and fuel cell technology. Policies and plans have been put forward densely in the recent five years. Numerous companies, research institutes, and universities are developing proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) and solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC)-related technologies. A preliminary local supplier chain of fuel cell-related technology has been formed. However, the lifetime is still a key issue for the fuel cell technology. More than 3500 fuel cell range extender electric vehicles were manufactured during 2016 and 2018, and at the beginning of 2019, there have been more than 40 hydrogen refueling stations including both under operation and under construction. It is estimated the number of fuel cell-based electric vehicles will reach 36,000 by the end of 2020; therefore, lack of hydrogen refueling station has become a key restriction for development of the fuel cell vehicle industry.\n",

To develop the technologies for sustainability and climate protection and at the same time to guarantee the supply of raw material is a big challenge for chemical industry. In the project CO2RRECT (CO2 - Reaction using Regenerative Energies and Catalytic Technologies), funded by the German federal ministry of Education and Research, carbon dioxide is used as the source of carbon for chemical products with certain chemical processes. Hydrogen that is needed in these processes is produced by electrolyzing water with renewable energy. To store a large amount of hydrogen, different storage systems are studied in this project, including liquid hydrogen tanks/cryo tanks, high pressure tanks, pipelines and salt cavities. These systems are analyzed and compared considering their storage capacity, system costs, advantages and disadvantages. To analyze capital and operational expenditure of the hydrogen storage systems a calculation methodology is also developed in this work.\n",

Harbour crafts as part of the larger maritime ecosystem, can significantly contribute to reduced emissions. In this paper, HyForce, the next generation 2 MW hydrogen powered virtual tugboat was designed for a feasibility assessment for her techno-economic and environmental footprint to replace existing diesel-powered tugboats. The study compares the use of hydrogen fuel cells and an internal combustion engine to perform the same dynamic load profile for a typical tugboat mission. The results from the study show that a signpost for commercial competitiveness of HyForce is influenced primarily by the projected liquid hydrogen cost of 5.10 USD per kg in 2040 with a 2,000 USD/kW capital cost for the fuel cells. Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions from a “well-to-wake” analysis for fossil-based hydrogen and renewable hydrogen supply chains were conducted, and the results show 26.9% and 75.6% reduction, respectively, compared to similar tug running on diesel fuel.\n",

      " \n",
      "Given the success of Delhi’s CNG vehicle program, energy stakeholders are now investigating a transition to hydrogen-compressed natural gas (H-CNG) blends in the city. Past research has shown H-CNG can reduce tailpipe emissions of both criteria and greenhouse gas pollutants relative to diesel, CNG, and gasoline [1–3]. However, an unanswered question is how Delhi will satisfy the potential hydrogen demand in a sustainable manner. We conduct a techno-economic assessment of hydrogen production from gasification of the three most abundant agricultural residues near Delhi – rice straw, cotton stalk, mustard stalk – and find these residues could provide the city with up to 270,700 metric tons per year of hydrogen. This quantity far exceeds what is needed to run all existing CNG vehicles on 18%–82% H-CNG blends. The cost of each step of the biohydrogen supply chain is calculated and the total cost is estimated at 149.6 rupees ($3.39) per kg. Lastly, we show that the price of H-CNG at the pump would be roughly equivalent to CNG on a per mile basis.\n",

      "The Haber–Bosch process produces ammonia from hydrogen and nitrogen gases in a globally important energy-intensive process that uses coal or natural gas as a fuel and hydrogen source. Direct electrochemical ammonia synthesis from nitrogen and water using renewable energy sources presents an alternative to the Haber–Bosch process that would be more sustainable. Additionally, the different production structure of direct electrochemical nitrogen reduction technology suggests a supply chain alternative to the ammonia industry and a method for load leveling of the electrical grid. This alternative route to ammonia from dinitrogen would require smaller capital investments than the Haber–Bosch process and would not require a fossil fuel supply. The impact of dynamic electrical power pricing is analyzed for a system that could take advantage of pricing volatility. We show that, under certain scenarios, at achievable levels of energy efficiency with a future electrocatalyst, direct nitrogen reduction would be economically competitive or advantageous compared with Haber–Bosch-based ammonia production.\n",

      " \n",
      "In this review we consider the important future of the synthetic fuel, dimethyl ether (DME). We compare DME to two alternatives [oxymethylene ether (OMEx) and synthetic diesel through Fischer-Tropsch (FT) reactions]. Finally, we explore a range of methodologies and processes for the synthesis of DME. DME is an alternative diesel fuel for use in compression ignition (CI) engines and may be produced from a range of waste feedstocks, thereby avoiding new fossil carbon from entering the supply chain. DME is characterised by low CO2, low NOx and low particulate matter (PM) emissions. Its high cetane number means it can be used in CI engines with minimal modifications. The key to creating a circular fuels economy is integrating multiple waste streams into an economically and environmentally sustainable supply chain. Therefore, we also consider the availability and nature of low-carbon fuels and hydrogen production. Reliable carbon dioxide sources are also essential if CO2 utilisation processes are to become commercially viable. The location of DME plants will depend on the local ecosystems and ideally should be co-located on or near waste emitters and low-carbon energy sources. Alternative liquid fuels are considered interesting in the medium term, while renewable electricity and hydrogen are considered as reliable long-term solutions for the future transport sector. DME may be considered as a circular hydrogen carrier which will also be able to store energy for use at times of low renewable power generation. The chemistry of the individual steps within the supply chain is generally well known and usually relies on the use of cheap and Earth-abundant metal catalysts. The thermodynamics of these processes are also well-characterised. So overcoming the challenge now relies on the expertise of chemical engineers to put the fundamentals into commercial practice. It is important that a whole systems approach is adopted as interventions can have detrimental unintended consequences unless close monitoring is applied. This review shows that while DME production has been achieved and shows great promise, there is considerable effort needed if we are to reach true net zero emissions in the transport sector, particularly long-haul road use, in the require timescales.\n",

To tackle several social agendas such as energy security, climate change, etc. Government of Japan has been strongly promoting activity toward realizing hydrogen based society. On December 26, 2017, the Japanese Government concluded the “Basic Hydrogen Strategy” to accomplish a world-leading hydrogen-based society. The strategy shows future visions toward 2050 and also serves as an action plan to accomplish the visions by 2030. The strategy sets a goal that Japan should reduce hydrogen costs to the same level of conventional energy and to achieve the goal, provides integrated policies across ministries ranging from hydrogen production to utilization under the common goals. Fuel cell applications has been penetrated to Japanese market. Total installation number of residential fuel cell has reached over 250,000. About 2,200 fuel cell vehicles have been sold and 100 hydrogen refueling stations have been operated. To enhancing utilization of hydrogen technology, the New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO) has been conducting comprehensive technology development and demonstrative research programs. The most recent result from NEDO’s program on fuel cell technology will be addressed.

In this framework, hydrogen will have the chance to play a major role but its penetration rate still represents a considerable uncertainty and needs to be investigated with special attention to show the real feasibility of a hydrogen economy advent.The paper presents the results obtained analysing a set of scenarios applied to a comprehensive TIMES-based bottom-up energy model developed to describe and assess the energy systems of the single European countries and of macroareas of the rest of the world in an integrated approach. The modelling tool considers the hydrogen supply chain since its production stage (together with its storage and distribution) and evaluates – minimising the total system cost and over a mid-long time horizon – the penetration of the hydrogen-based end-use technologies.The analysis shows that the residential and, above all, the transport sector may see a considerable diffusion of technologies supplied with hydrogen and especially for urban application, pushed by the upcoming stricter environmental constraints to the energy sector.\n",

      "Fuel cell cars powered by hydrogen enable CO2-emission free mobility. A main requirement for the success of this technology is the availability of an area-wide and affordable hydrogen supply. A significant cost factor in the hydrogen supply chain is the multi-stage gas compression to provide the mandatory filling pressure for the pressurized tanks. One way to address this issue is to perform the hydrogen production process at elevated pressure. In this paper the feasibility of compressed hydrogen production without additional gas compression based on the steam iron process is discussed. Experiments were performed in a lab-scale test rig using fixed bed reactor technology. The focus was to evaluate the influence of pressurized hydrogen production on the cycle stability, on the conversion efficiency and on the structural integrity of a Fe2O3–Al2O3 (90+10wt%) oxygen carrier. The oxidations were performed at different pressure levels of 7–22bar (g) at a temperature of 750°C with steam. The steady steam supply was ensured by a HPLC pump which delivered 0.03gmin−1 (at room temperature) of water, which was evaporated in the heated inlet section. The water was introduced for approximately 100min until the oxygen carrier was fully oxidized. The iron oxide was reduced in the subsequent reaction steps at 750°C and ambient pressure with 25Nmlmin−1 H2 as reducing agent. The reduction reactions were analyzed to evaluate possible influences of its prior oxidations. The results revealed no signs of negative repercussions. The oxygen carrier conversion of initially 84% remained at a steady behavior between the 15 performed cycles. Only small losses of 0.8% per cycle caused by thermal sintering of the contact mass were observed, which was independent from the different pressure levels of the prior oxidations. The evaluation of the pressurized oxidations did not reveal any performance decrease as well. The rise of pressure in each oxidation showed a consistent characteristic throughout the complete test series. Scanning electron microscopy analysis of the oxygen carrier sample after the experiment revealed some structural changes, which are related to thermal sintering but the structural integrity of the sample stayed intact. The oxidations yielded an average of 18mmolgFe−1 hydrogen with a maximum hydrogen pressure of 22bar (g). The conducted experiments showed that the steam iron process is very suitable for the production of compressed hydrogen and that the process is not negatively influenced by the elevated system pressure.\n",

      "Along the hydrogen supply chain, metallic components, such as pressure vessels, compressors and valves, are facing high pressure hydrogen gas. The object of this paper is to address microstructural as well as mechanical aspects of fatigue crack initiation and growth at room temperature in a quenched and tempered (Q&T) low alloy steel under hydrogen pressure in the range 0.5–35 MPa. For such steel, the need to perform tests in-situ under hydrogen pressure is required. The influence of hydrogen gas on the total life in terms of crack initiation and crack propagation is analyzed. The experimental techniques developed to detect crack initiation in a pressure vessel under hydrogen pressure are presented. Thanks to these technical developments the influence of hydrogen gas on the total life duration including crack initiation and crack propagation is analyzed. It is shown that the effect of hydrogen pressure on crack initiation is important. At constant load ratio, the hydrogen pressure effect on fatigue crack growth (FCG) is dependent on the loading amplitude (in terms of ΔK). These results related to cracking behavior are enriched with information on fracture surfaces appearance. The results presented have been achieved within the European project MATHRYCE [1] dedicated to Material Testing and Recommendations for Hydrogen Components under fatigue. They are part of a process necessary to give a scientific background to the development of a design methodology where hydrogen enhanced fatigue damage is taken into account.\n",

      "Towards decarbonizing the global economy, hydrogen produced through water electrolysis is expected to be one of the key solutions for variable renewable energy storage and sector coupling, in particular, via the transport sector in the next few decades. Even though water is an important aspect of the environmental impact, the impact assessment of hydrogen production on water is lacking. This paper proposes a comprehensive methodology for assessing the water footprints of hydrogen production from electrolysis. A major innovative aspect is to demonstrate the geographical distribution of the footprints along the supply chain. The water footprints for hydrogen produced from grid electricity, wind and solar power in Australia was analysed as a case study. Sensitivity analysis was used to evaluate the influence of key parameters including Solar Radiation Level, Silicon Efficiency, and Lifetime of PV Modules. The study finds that the water consumption footprint is much less than that reported in the literature and large part of the water could be consumed indirectly outside of hydrogen producing countries. The quantity of water footprint varies significantly among different assumptions. The findings provide insights into both domestic and cross-boundary water impacts of hydrogen electrolysis and can thus inform policy debates in each nation and beyond.\n",

      "Green hydrogen has been known in the UK since Robert Boyle described flammable air in 1671. This paper describes how green hydrogen has become a new priority for the UK in 2021, beginning to replace fossil hydrogen production exceeding 1 Mte in 2021 when the British Government started to inject significant funding into green hydrogen sources, though much less than the USA, Germany, Japan and China. Recent progress in the UK was initiated in 2008 when the first UK green hydrogen station opened in Birmingham University, refuelling 5 hydrogen fuel cell battery electric vehicles (HFCBEVs) for the 50 PhD chemical engineering students that arrived in 2009. Only 10 kg/day were required, in contrast to the first large, green ITM power station delivering almost 600 kg/day of green hydrogen that opened in the UK, in Tyseley, in July 2021. The first question asked in this paper is: ‘What do you mean, Green?’. Then, the Clean Air Zone (CAZ) in Birmingham is described, with the key innovations defined. Progress in UK green hydrogen and fuel cell introduction is then recounted. The remarks of Elon Musk about this ‘Fool Cell; Mind bogglingly stupid’ technology are analysed to show that he is incorrect. The immediate deployment of green hydrogen stations around the UK has been planned. Another century may be needed to make green hydrogen dominant across the country, yet we will be on the correct path, once a profitable supply chain is established in 2022.\n",

Herein, we reported a molecular design principle of polydiarylfluorenes for realizing pure-blue light emission that is introducing functional side chains containing carbazole and amide groups. Resulting from the steric hindrance effect of carbazole groups, the hydrogen bond interactions among the side-chain amide groups were destroyed. As a consequence, both solution-processed films and PLEDs based on such films presented pure-deep-blue emission with the Commission International de L’Eclairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.15, 0.10) and (0.17, 0.14), respectively. Time-resolved transient spectroscopy revealed their similar exciton behaviors in film excited states, and the ultrafast energy transfer occurred within tens of picoseconds. These insights enable us a deeper understanding about the influence of functional side chains on the optoelectronic properties and supply a feasible design strategy for high-performance conjugated polymers.\n",

      " \n",
      "The utilization of electricity-based fuels (e-fuels) is a potential strategy component for achieving greenhouse gas neutrality in the European Union (EU). As renewable electricity production sites in the EU itself might be scarce and relatively expensive, importing e-fuels from the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) could be a complementary and cost-efficient option. Using the energy system model Enertile, supply curves for hydrogen and synthetic methane in the MENA region are determined for the years 2030 and 2050 to evaluate this import option techno-economically. The model optimizes investments in renewable electricity production, e-fuel production chains, and local electricity transport infrastructures. Analyses of renewable electricity generation potentials show that the MENA region in particular has large low-cost solar power potentials. Optimization results in Enertile show for a weighted average cost of capital of 7% that substantial hydrogen production starts above 100 €/MWhH2 in 2030 and above 70 €/MWhH2 in 2050. Substantial synthetic methane production in the model results starts above 170 €/MWhCH4 in 2030 and above 120 €/MWhCH4 in 2050. The most important cost component in both fuel production routes is electricity. Taking into account transport cost surcharges, in Europe synthetic methane from MENA is available above 180 €/MWhCH4 in 2030 and above 130 €/MWhCH4 in 2050. Hydrogen exports from MENA to Europe cost above 120 €/MWhH2 in 2030 and above 90 €/MWhH2 in 2050. If exported to Europe, both e-fuels are more expensive to produce and transport in liquefied form than in gaseous form. A comparison of European hydrogen supply curves with hydrogen imports from MENA for 2050 reveals that imports can only be economically efficient if the two following conditions are met: Firstly, similar interest rates prevail in the EU and MENA; secondly, hydrogen transport costs converge at the cheap end of the range in the current literature. Apart from this, a shortage of land for renewable electricity generation in Europe may lead to hydrogen imports from MENA. This analysis is intended to assist in guiding European industrial and energy policy, planning import infrastructure needs, and providing an analytical framework for project developers in the MENA region.\n",

      " \n",
      "In this study, we compressed hydrogen up to 70 MPa in a non-mechanical device based on cyclic, thermally driven, hydrogen adsorption/desorption on activated carbon (AC). Hydrogen compression comes from the desorption of a pre-adsorbed amount of hydrogen at 77 K on a bed of AC closely packed in high-pressure reservoir. A prototype of 0.5 L containing an AC (MSC-30, Kansai, Japan) having a BET area higher than 3000 m2 g−1 and a volume of micropores around 1 cm3 g−1, was used. The effect of the AC amount, the hydrogen charging pressure and the temperature of desorption on the compression performances was investigated, both experimentally and numerically. Hydrogen was introduced at 8 MPa and pre-adsorbed on 0.135 kg of MSC-30 at 77K. A high-pressure hydrogen flow, up to 28 NL h−1 at 70 MPa, was obtained in a single step when heating the compressor from 77 to 315 K. We proved that high surface area, large volume of micropores, as well as very narrow pores, are the essential requirements for any AC to be used in such compressor. The use of microporous AC in a thermally driven device for hydrogen compression, based on cyclic adsorption/desorption, had never been investigated before. This innovative system might solve several issues hindering the development of the hydrogen supply chain.\n",

      "Norway is a nation with an abundant supply of energy, both from fossil and renewable resources. Due to limited domestic demand, Norway is today exporting large amounts of petroleum products. For the future, various options for export of CO2-lean energy exist, both from Northern and Southern Norway, and both from fossil sources (including carbon capture and storage), and renewable energies (particularly wind power). Transport vectors are hydrogen pipelines, liquid hydrogen ships and HVDC cables, and a plausible customer is central Europe due to its proximity, high population density and lack of domestic energy resources.Within the framework of the “NorWays” project, various options to deliver energy for hydrogen-based transportation from Norway to Germany were studied. Eight CO2-lean well-to-wheel energy export chains were evaluated with respect to efficiency, GHG emissions and other environmental impacts, costs and utilisation of Norwegian R&D experience. In the chosen scenarios, energy export via hydrogen pipelines and ships appeared energetically and economically interesting against existing approaches as NG and electricity export. Furthermore, increased utilisation of Norwegian R&D experience and higher value creation is anticipated by the export of a higher refined product.\n",

      "The energy transition paradigm consists in a substitution of fossil energy for renewable resources, and low carbon transportation is one of the most important issues within this process. The oil century introduced modern mobility to society, and since then petroleum supply has been a key to control transportation services. Energy security and environment issues, as well as business perspectives of innovative technological chains implementation at national and international stage, are major drivers for decarbonisation of the transportation services for East Asian economies. Policy, institutions and technological patterns toward less carbon footprints of the transportation sector are overviewed in the article. The emphasis is done on hydrogen technologies applications, corresponding drivers and ambitions of industrialised East Asian economies to establish hydrogen infrastructure at national stage. The major factors for the hydrogen technologies and hydrogen infrastructure developments in China, Japan, the Republic of Korea and Taiwan are briefly discussed. The role of the road transportation systems in such development is highlighted. Current energy consumption for transportation is described, some official documents are reviewed, and a snapshot of recent development is provided for each of these economies.\n",

      "Hydrogen has the highest mass specific energy content of all conventional fuels and is the most abundant element in the universe. It is considered as a renewable resource and sustainable solution for reducing global fossil fuel consumption and combating global warming. In general, it must be transported from production plants to demand points. Thus, the delivery process of its supply chain leads to the possibility of there being new forms of hazard. Pipelines have proven to be one of the cheapest ways to transport hydrogen. However, failures in pipelines can pose major risks. In this context, this paper proposes a multicriteria decision model for assessing the risk in hydrogen pipelines. By incorporating the decision maker's preferences structure into the decision process, the model enables sections of the pipeline to be ranked in terms of risk. The model proposed in this work is considered as an evolution of previous studies in the area, due to new features incorporated in the process. Finally, a numerical application is conducted in order to test the model.\n",

      " \n",
      "Hydrogen compression is a key part of the green hydrogen supply chain, but mechanical compressors are prone to failure and add system complexity and cost. High-pressure water electrolysis can alleviate this problem through electrochemical compression of the gas internally in the electrolyzer and thereby eliminating the need for an external hydrogen compressor. In this work, a detailed techno-economic assessment of high-pressure proton exchange membrane-based water electrolysis (PEMEL) systems was carried out. Electrolyzers operating at 80, 200, 350, and 700 bar were compared to state-of-the-art systems operating at 30 bar in combination with a mechanical compressor. The results show that it is possible to achieve economically viable solutions with high-pressure PEMEL-systems operating up to 200 bar. These pressure levels fit well with the requirements in existing and future industrial applications, such as e-fuel production (30–120 bar), injection of hydrogen into natural gas grids (70 bar), hydrogen gas storage (≥200 bar), and ammonia production (200–300 bar). A sensitivity analysis also showed that if the cost of electricity is sufficiently low (<0.1 €kWh−1), it may even be economical to operate PEMEL systems with hydrogen outlet pressures up to 350 bar.\n",

      " \n",
      "In this research, an aspect of sustainable development is investigated by considering the energy efficiency improvement of the hydrogen fuel cell cars on a supply chain including government, supplier, manufacturer, agency, and customers. The manufacturer produces the hydrogen fuel cell cars and sells them to customers via his agency. The monopolistic supplier procures the hydrogen fuel for customers. The manufacturer aims to improve the energy efficiency rate of his products by reducing their fuel consumption. In this setting, the government stimulates the manufacturer to invest in this scheme by paying a subsidy to him as well as by reducing his tax rate. Based on these governmental policies, the problem is investigated under different scenarios. Then, the game-theoretic frameworks are applied to make the equilibrium decisions. Finally, the given decisions are analyzed to reveal some managerial insights. It is found that the demand of the hydrogen fuel cell cars and the members’ profits increase as the efficiency improvement rate increases. Moreover, by increasing the subsidy rate paid to the manufacturer and by decreasing the tax rate imposed on him, the government can increase the demand of the hydrogen cars and provide more incentive for the members to incorporate into the business.\n",

Relative to fossil-based jet fuel, the mallee jet fuel was found to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40% and result in a net fossil fuel depletion benefit. Further greenhouse gas reductions could be achieved by optimizing the supply chain through measures such as capturing methane emissions for hydrogen production and utilizing co-produced biodiesel. The magnitudes of the environmental benefits are sensitive to a number of methodology assumptions, including the approach to potential food displacement and co-production.\n",

      "Large-scale energy storage and mobility infrastructures are imperative for meeting the current global energy demand. With hydrogen increasingly emerging as a potential energy carrier, the development of global hydrogen mobility infrastructures is essential to accelerate the transition to a hydrogen economy. In this work, a comprehensive cradle-to-gate life cycle assessment (LCA) was performed for seven hydrogen delivery pathways: compressed gas via pipeline (CGH2-PL), compressed gas via tube trailer (CGH2-TT), liquid hydrogen (LH2), liquid organic hydrogen carrier with natural gas as a heating source (LOHC), liquid ammonia (LNH3), liquid organic hydrogen carrier with hydrogen as a heating source (LOHC-Own), and the direct utilization of NH3 in direct ammonia fuel cell vehicle (LNH3-DAFCV). The LCA results showed that CGH2-PL is the most sustainable option among all the above mentioned pathways as it showed to have the lowest global warming potential (GWP) (1.57 kgCO2-eq/kgH2). On the contrary, delivery via LOHC had the worst results and would have the highest emissions (3.58 kgCO2-eq/kgH2). However, by partially utilizing the produced hydrogen to fulfill the heating requirements during dehydrogenation (LOHC-Own), approximately 35% of the GWP was reduced to 2.34 kgCO2-eq/kgH2. Likely, delivery via LNH3 also showed significant emissions (3.14 kgCO2-eq/kgH2) and remained the second worst candidate for hydrogen delivery. However, the direct utilization of NH3 in DAFCV showed promising results for GWP (1.62 kgCO2-eq/kgH2), making NH3 a likely candidate for future hydrogen and energy carriers.\n",

      "As the use of fossil fuels becomes more and more restricted there is a need for alternative fuels also at sea. For short sea distance travel purposes, batteries may be a solution. However, for longer distances, when there is no possibility of recharging at sea, batteries do not have sufficient capacity yet. Several projects have demonstrated the use of compressed hydrogen (CH2) as a fuel for road transport. The experience with hydrogen as a maritime fuel is very limited. In this paper, the similarities and differences between liquefied hydrogen (LH2) and liquefied natural gas (LNG) as a maritime fuel will be discussed based on literature data of their properties and our system knowledge. The advantages and disadvantages of the two fuels will be examined with respect to use as a maritime fuel. Our objective is to discuss if and how hydrogen could replace fossil fuels on long distance sea voyages. Due to the low temperature of LH2 and wide flammability range in air these systems have more challenges related to storage and processing onboard than LNG. These factors result in higher investment costs. All this may also imply challenges for the LH2 supply chain.\n",

      "A highly efficient Ni-Pt bimetallic catalyst over Al2O3 for the conversion of oleic acid to heptadecane without using external hydrogen source is synthesized by the atomic layer deposition (ALD). The combined characterizations of HAADF-STEM, in-situ XAFS and CO-DRIFTS confirmed that Ni-Pt-ALD formed a Pt-skin structure over the sub-surface Ni particles. With the modification of Ni, the Pt-skin bimetallic particles exhibit excellent activity and selectivity in the upgrade reaction of oleic acid to aviation fuels. The yield of heptadecane reaches 91%, near the theoretical upper limit of the “self-hydrogen supply-consumption”. The remarkable catalytic performance of the Ni-Pt-ALD catalyst demonstrates that the subsurface Ni-modulated Pt skin structure is capable of integrating the dehydrogenation, decarboxylation and hydrogenation reactions. The undesired side reactions such as alkyl chain aromatization and polymerization could be effectively inhibited.\n",

In the first step, the FFA present in OODD were neutralized with choline hydrogen carbonate to form choline carboxylates. The choline carboxylates obtained are of interest to the cosmetic industry. Due to their ionic character, they are insoluble in scCO2. Therefore in the second step, the reaction mixture was subjected to extraction with scCO2 at 15MPa, 313K and a gas flow rate of 2mlmin−1, yielding an extract with a maximum FFA content of ca. 3% (w/w).

      "Hydrogen gas inhalation has not yet been elucidated to improve blood behaviors or antioxidant activity in blood. In the present study, the PEM (proton-exchange-membrane)-/platinum-plated electrode-equipped electrolyzer was examined as a hydrogen gas inhaler, which was estimated to supply 3% hydrogen as rapidly as post-operating 10–15 min, together with continuous 30 min retention of 20.8% oxygen being nearly equal to atmospheric oxygen contents. The 40 min inhalation of 3% hydrogen gas and thereafter 60 min rest were shown to enhance the antioxidant ability in human serum, as evaluated by ORAC (oxygen radical absorbing capacity)-based fluorometry, although scarcely enhanced for air dummy inhalation. Unexpectedly, antioxidant ability was 2.50-fold more enhanced for post-inhalational 0–60 min rest than during 40 min inhalation. Oxidative stress-suffering erythrocytes formed a rosary-chain-like aggregation composed of 3–6 cells, together with loss of a single hollow/biconcave-discoid structure in the cell central-part being necessary for erythrocyte passing through capillary vessels, both of which were prevented by 3% hydrogen gas inhalation. Hydrogen gas inhalation increased the intracellular foreign bodies, being distinguished from vacuole/cyst, in leucocytes, suggesting the hydrogen-activated leukocyte phagocytosis-associated events. Thus, 3%-hydrogen gas inhalation is suggested to potentially improve both the erythrocyte rheological/morphologic behaviors and the leucocyte phagocytosis-associated activity, concurrently with the enhanced antioxidant ability in blood.\n",

Regarding market status, Japan has success to market introduction of hydrogen technology. Fuel cell micro combined heat and power system for household has been on market since 2009 and over 150,000 units are installed. Fuel cell vehicle was launched in December 2014 and around 70 hydrogen refueling stations have been operated now.  The New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO) has been conducting comprehensive technology development and demonstrative research programs on hydrogen energy. The most recent result from NEDO’s program such as new materials for PEFC, analysis technology of morphology, electrochemical reaction and mass transfer in MEA, evaluation technology for long time fuel cell durability will be addressed. Following current topic, NEDO’s future challenge to develop hydrogen energy demand will be presented.

      " \n",
      "Abstract  Hydrogen is a reliable energy vector and its storage is strongly connected to the costs, performance and level of safety of the storage system components. Several materials for physical and chemical hydrogen storage have been proposed, but few research works were devoted to polymers, that generally are low cost and weight materials, easy to be managed and manufactured. In this work, a functionalised Poly(ether ether ketone) (PEEK) polymer was studied and chosen as a base polymeric matrix with the aim to produce both a low cost and low weight hydrogen storage material. The polymer was in situ functionalised starting from a manganese oxide precursor. The obtained oxide, bonded to the polymer chain, allows the hydrogen storage. In this work, the functionalisation process and preliminary results of the hydrogen storage capability are reported.  From Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and surface area measurements (BET), it has been verified that the metallic compound introduction modifies the morphology of the material, supplies an increased surface area for hydrogen chemisorption, revealing a 1.2%wt/wt hydrogen adsorption capability at 77 K. Preliminary results by Gravimetric Hydrogen Absorption measurements show that by increasing the temperature, the hydrogen storage capability is reduced and a value of 0.3%wt/wt at 50°C and 80 absolute bar was obtained. The reversibility cycles of hydrogen adsorption-desorption seem to be confirmed. For this reason such approach has been considered as a promising pathway and deeper studies are in progress.\n",

      " \n",
      "In this study the methodology of life cycle assessment has been used to assess the environmental impacts of three pulverized coal fired electricity supply chains with and without carbon capture and storage (CCS) on a cradle to grave basis. The chain with CCS comprises post-combustion CO2 capture with monoethanolamine, compression, transport by pipeline and storage in a geological reservoir. The two reference chains represent sub-critical and state-of-the-art ultra supercritical pulverized coal fired electricity generation. For the three chains we have constructed a detailed greenhouse gas (GHG) balance, and disclosed environmental trade-offs and co-benefits due to CO2 capture, transport and storage. Results show that, due to CCS, the GHG emissions per kWh are reduced substantially to 243g/kWh. This is a reduction of 78 and 71% compared to the sub-critical and state-of-the-art power plant, respectively. The removal of CO2 is partially offset by increased GHG emissions in up- and downstream processes, to a small extent (0.7g/kWh) caused by the CCS infrastructure. An environmental co-benefit is expected following from the deeper reduction of hydrogen fluoride and hydrogen chloride emissions. Most notable environmental trade-offs are the increase in human toxicity, ozone layer depletion and fresh water ecotoxicity potential for which the CCS chain is outperformed by both other chains. The state-of-the-art power plant without CCS also shows a better score for the eutrophication, acidification and photochemical oxidation potential despite the deeper reduction of SOx and NOx in the CCS power plant. These reductions are offset by increased emissions in the life cycle due to the energy penalty and a factor five increase in NH3 emissions.\n",

      "Hydrogen has attracted significant global attention as a source of clean energy. With the increasing focus on utilizing hydrogen as a clean fuel, large-scale storage and transportation have emerged as essential parts of the hydrogen supply chain. Liquid hydrogen (LH2) is the most suitable alternative in this regard; additionally, LH2 ensures the purest form of hydrogen. Since hydrogen is primarily produced from fossil-based fuels, its purification is a critical step during LH2 production. Conventionally, pressure swing adsorption is adopted as a purification technique for this purpose. In contrast, cryogenic techniques have the limitations of low purity and recovery. In this study, a unique cryogenic approach with dual advantages, viz. hydrogen enrichment through CO2 solidification and precooling of hydrogen, is adopted. This is the first simulation study conducted on the removal of CO2 from a mixture of H2 and CO2 using anti-sublimation. The proposed process was simulated using Aspen Hysys® V11. The anti-sublimation process was performed in a specially designed chamber equipped with a refrigeration cycle. The anti-sublimation conditions were verified based on the phase behaviors of the H2/CO2 mixture and pure CO2. The purified and precooled hydrogen was liquified using three refrigeration cycles. The overall specific energy consumption of the proposed process is 9.62 kWh/kg, which is lower than those of commercial LH2 production processes. Moreover, the high exergy efficiency (31.5%) favors this unique approach of hydrogen enrichment and liquefaction. The economic analysis of the proposed process revealed a total acquisition cost (TAC) of 52.8 mil $/y. The results of this study will assist engineers to develop a sustainable green economy by enhancing the competitiveness of large-scale hydrogen storage and transportation.\n",

      "Molecular dynamics simulations have been performed by means of density functional theory with tight binding (DFTB) in order to describe the structure and the energetic stability of water bridges in humic substances (HS) model. This model is constructed from two parallel aliphatic chains geometrically restrained on one end and terminated with a carboxyl group on the other to supply the structural pattern for supramolecular contact of two HS chains through hydrogen bonds. Molecular dynamics simulations were used to analyze the interactions of the carboxylic groups with a variable number of water molecules up to 14 representing domains of micro hydration states of polar centers in humic acids. For the present geometrical arrangements of the model five water molecules form a stable bridge between the two carboxylic groups located at each aliphatic chain. The effect of environment through three solvents of different polarities (n-hexane, acetonitrile and water) was investigated. Distribution profiles of oxygen atoms of carboxyl and chain water molecules show that the environmental effect of the solvent with moderate polarity (acetonitrile) is most pronounced in exerting an ordering effect on the water bridge. Energy profiles for incremental addition of water molecules and hydrogen bond analysis demonstrate the remarkable stability of the five water complex as compared to all other models investigated in both gas phase and in acetonitrile. These findings correlate nicely with experimentally observed antiplasticizing effects of water bridges in organic matrices.\n",

      "Hydrogen technologies can play an important role in decarbonising our energy system in a variety of ways across the energy value chain. It is therefore critical to identify the strategic roles as well as the conditions under which hydrogen energy systems become attractive for the energy transition. In this paper, the authors present a techno-economic review of hydrogen energy systems including power-to-power, power-to-gas, hydrogen refuelling and stationary fuel cells. We focus on their optimal operation as flexible assets and we identify three actions that can foster their uptake beyond technological progress. First, we recommend optimal electricity supply with dedicated control strategies considering that electricity dominates the levelised cost of hydrogen production via electrolysis. Secondly, hydrogen can enable the further integration of traditionally independent sectors, namely electricity, heat and transport while contributing to decarbonise all. This position can also be advantageous for investors who sell heat and fuels as energy efficient products. Lastly, we examine a whole range of revenues from different products and applications which can be combined (i.e. benefit stacking) to match capital and operational expenditures. We discuss these roles in depth and we conclude that policy makers together with technology developers should elaborate smart strategies to reduce cost by scaling production, stimulate standardisation (e.g., similar to the PV industry) as well as develop new market structures and regulatory frameworks which allow hydrogen technologies to deliver multiple low carbon applications and products.\n",

      "The oxidation of hydrogen under well stirred, flowing conditions is the natural prototype of branched-chain reactions in open, gaseous systems. Experimentally, it exhibits the classical forms for the ( p - T a ) first and second ignition limits in the flow system. The constant reactant supply ensures that stationary states exist at subcritical conditions whereas the supercritical reaction is a repetitive, oscillatory sequence of events. In a linked pair of papers, we investigate isothermal criticality at the second limit in terms of changing nature of the singularities for the mass conservation equations and derive kinetic relationships that explain the oscillatory features. In this paper the origins of oscillatory ignition are traced analytically to chain-branching via H atoms coupled to the changing third-body efficiency in the elementary process H + O 2 + M → HO 2 + M, when water formed during ignition is displaced by the inflow of fresh hydrogen and oxygen. Analytical predictions are made of the periods between successive ignitions and of the conditions at which oscillatory reaction is transformed to a stationary state. A composition limit for the existence of oscillatory ignition in the (lean) mixture H 2 + 15O 2 + 14N 2 is located experimentally and explained in terms of the analytical inter­pretations presented here.\n",

      "Cheap Fe/graphite electrodes substantially enhanced hydrogen production from anaerobic waste activated sludge digestion in a microbial electrolysis cell.                      Low hydrogen production from anaerobic digestion of sludge has greatly limited the application of biological hydrogen-producing technology. An Fe/graphite electrode was installed into an anaerobic digester to enhance the hydrogen production from waste sludge in this study. The electrode accelerated the decomposition of the sludge, and the production of short-chain fatty acids was 3.5 folds of that in a control anaerobic reactor with no electrode. The hydrogen production was 90.6 mL g                     VSS −1                     , while it was almost undetectable in the control.

The excessive consumption of the cathodic H                     +                     drove the pH up to 9.2–9.5 in the electric-anaerobic system which inevitably inhibited the occurrence of methanogenesis. This led to quite low methane production in this electric-anaerobic system. The microbial analysis showed that exoelectrogens were enriched in the presence of an Fe electrode. It catalyzed the anodic oxidation of the sludge to produce more electrons for the cathodic hydrogen production. Raising the voltage supply boosted the H                     2                     production, but the net energy output was obtained at 0.3 and 0.6 V.\n",

      "Higher penetration of renewable energy sources in the energy mix and increasing pressure to decarbonize society introduces new challenges. Energy storage and grid stabilization systems are necessary to address the intermittent nature of renewable energy sources (wind, solar etc.) [1]–[4]. Renewable energy storage in form of hydrogen offers an attractive option for energy storage [5], [6]. With advent of hydrogen economy and growing number of fuel cell vehicles, local production and supply of hydrogen infrastructure for refueling stations is essential [7]–[9].  An r-SOC electrochemical reactor system is capable addressing these multiple challenges of energy storage and coupling the energy storage sector with hydrogen economy sector. Electricity storage is achieved by operating such a system in electrolysis mode (reduction of H 2 O). Electrical energy is converted to chemical energy in form of hydrogen. The produced hydrogen can be supplied into gas grids or stored locally which can be supplied to hydrogen refueling stations. During high demand for electricity, the system can be switched to fuel cell mode during which the stored hydrogen is efficiently converted to electricity. r-SOC systems offer an interesting feasible solution for the following challenges: 1) Efficient electricity storage, 2) Grid stabilization required for intermittent renewable energy, 3) Sector coupling of energy storage sector with hydrogen economy supply chain and 4) A decentralized solution for the above challenges via e.g. hydrogen refueling stations.  An r-SOC system as described above poses certain technical challenges as requirements of a stand-alone SOEC (solid oxide electrolysis cell) system and a stand-alone SOFC (solid oxide fuel cell) system are different from each other. The simplest design approach for an r-SOC system calls for thermoneutral or exothermic electrolysis operation, although this will yield low round trip efficiencies in the range of 35 % [10]. Coupling highly efficient endothermic electrolysis and exothermic fuel cell mode allows for significantly higher round trip efficiencies up to 60 %. Therefore thermal integration, storage and management between the two modes of operation are crucial. In this study, a process system study of an r-SOC electrochemical reactor system is performed. Process system analysis is performed based on experimental investigation of a commercially available r-SOC reactor carried out under pressurized conditions. Opportunities of integrating thermal energy storage are investigated. Detailed process system architectures are discussed and effects of key system operating parameters are analyzed. Achievable system roundtrip efficiencies for the different scenarios using currently available r-SOC reactor technology are quantified.

      "The potential environmental benefits of using fuel cells in cars, buses and stationary combined heat and power (CHP) plants of different sizes have not been well-researched. This environmental analysis was conducted for the UK on a `full fuel cycle' basis, encompassing all greenhouse gas and regulated pollutant emissions for the supply chain and end-use technology under consideration. Solid polymer fuel cells (SPFCs) with methanol or natural gas reformers were analysed for cars, SPFCs and phosphoric acid fuel cells (PAFCs) with on-board hydrogen for buses. CHP plants were PAFCs or solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs). Each option was compared with one or more conventional technologies. In all cases fuel cell technologies have substantially reduced emissions in comparison with conventional technologies. Regulated emissions are lowest, by up to two orders of magnitude, and those that do occur are primarily in the fuel supply chain. The fuel cell technologies are more efficient in all cases, and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions are reduced broadly in line with energy savings. Methane emissions increase due to fuel switching, e.g. from petrol to natural gas powered buses, but from a very low base. The study pinpoints some areas in which alternative approaches could be made – the methods for generating and transporting hydrogen have a significant bearing on energy consumption and emissions. However, it is clear that from an overall emissions perspective the use of fuel cells in transport and power generation is highly beneficial.\n",

      "To utilize CO2 in syngas from coal gasification with H2S impurity for microalgal biodiesel production, metabolic regulation stimulated by NaHS (an H2S donor) of carbon allocation and energy supply in Nannochloropsis oceanica were investigated to improve lipid accumulation. Enzyme analysis showed that H2S (NaHS ≤0.5 mM) enhanced glycolysis and fatty acids synthesis, as well as suppressed the desaturation, elongation, and degradation of fatty acids during intracellular carbon metabolism. Additionally, H2S transformed the main ATP synthesis pathway from oxidative phosphorylation to photophosphorylation and substrate phosphorylation, facilitating efficient energy supply during lipid accumulation. Raman spectra and transmission electron microscopy showed that the peak rate of lipid accumulation increased by 60.2–62.2% in N. oceanica cells exposed to 0.5 mM NaHS. This markedly increased the yields of fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) and short-chain FAMEs (C12:0 and C14:0) from N. oceanica cells by 77.0 and 144.4%, respectively, and decreased the unsaturated lipid composition in total FAMEs by 44.8%.\n",

Besides, with the pursuit of green hydrogen, hydrogen-based hybrid renewable energy systems have become the focus of the development of the hydrogen industry. This paper compares different artificial intelligence applications in hydrogen-based hybrid renewable energy systems and carries out a case study in a typical area. Firstly, this paper summarizes important works in literature, which use artificial intelligence methods to predict the supply chain of the renewable energy system, including the prediction of renewable energy system resources, output power, load demand and terminal electricity price. Secondly, main articles about artificial intelligence optimization algorithms used in renewable energy systems are also summarized, including swarm and non-swarm biological heuristics, physical or chemical heuristics and hybrid optimization algorithms. Finally, a case study is carried out in Tikanlik, Xinjiang, China. Tikanlik’s weather and load data train the artificial neural network to predict system output power. It shows that 99.32% of the relative error of the test set is less than 3%, which proves that this model can achieve good prediction results.\n",

These nanotubes aggregated to form nanotube dendrites when the carboxylic acids contain an OH group. Moreover, the number of OH and COOH groups of the carboxylic acids affected the size, aggregated dendrite morphology, and thermal and electrical properties of the nanotubes. It was proposed that the micelle formed by the carboxylic acids acts as a template in the formation of the nanotubes, while the hydrogen bonds between the polymer chain of PANI and the OH group of the carboxylic acids supply a driving force to form the aggregated nanotube dendrites.\n",

      "In recent years, there has been considerable interest in the development of zero-emissions, sustainable energy systems utilising the potential of hydrogen energy technologies. However, the improper long-term economic assessment of costs and consequences of such hydrogen-based renewable energy systems has hindered the transition to the so-called hydrogen economy in many cases. One of the main reasons for this is the inefficiency of the optimization techniques employed to estimate the whole-life costs of such systems. Owing to the highly nonlinear and non-convex nature of the life-cycle cost optimization problems of sustainable energy systems using hydrogen as an energy carrier, meta-heuristic optimization techniques must be utilised to solve them. To this end, using a specifically developed artificial intelligence-based micro-grid capacity planning method, this paper examines the performances of twenty meta-heuristics in solving the optimal design problems of three conceptualised hydrogen-based micro-grids, as test-case systems. Accordingly, the obtained numeric simulation results using MATLAB indicate that some of the newly introduced meta-heuristics can play a key role in facilitating the successful, cost-effective development and implementation of hydrogen supply chain models. Notably, the moth-flame optimization algorithm is found capable of reducing the life-cycle costs of micro-grids by up to 6.5% as compared to the dragonfly algorithm.\n",

      " \n",
      "A novel option to produce bimodal polyethylene is by using binary catalytic systems, able to generate polyethylene chains with different predominant molecular weights in only one-step polymerization process. In this work, we explore in depth the catalytic behavior of a binary chromium-metallocene catalyst in the co-polymerizations of ethylene with 1-butene or 1-hexene looking for the production of bimodal polyethylene with an adequate comonomer profile across its molecular weight distribution. Likewise, the effect of the hydrogen together with comonomers was also evaluated for controlling polymers properties. Results indicate that the relative contribution of chromium and metallocene sites in the binary catalyst is strongly affected by using comonomers. Specifically, chromium contribution noticeably increases when using 1-hexene or 1-butene due to the positive comonomer effect observed in the individual chromium catalyst. The methodology used for hydrogen supply (continuous or discontinuous addition) plays a key role for tuning catalytic activity and polyethylene bimodality. Finally, comonomer placement across the molecular weight distribution of bimodal polyethylenes shows a growing profile, with a higher SCB concentration in the longest polymer chains than that obtained for a commercial PE100 sample.\n",

      "Biomass has the specific characteristic of being included in a short regeneration cycle that minimizes its ecological impact and should give it a preferential role in the energy transition. The scale up in the deployment of bioenergy requires an objective approach to processes. It is necessary to identify, according to a defined and available biomass, the most appropriate processes and products to extend their deployment This requires deep process analysis to identify achievable optimizations and opportunities of improvement. In order to provide criteria to identify the upper theoretical limits of biomass conversion, a theoretical approach to the conversion of two biomass (lignocellulosic and microalguae) into simple energy vector as alkanes, alcohols, carbon monoxide or hydrogen is carried out. Modelling highlights the importance of stoichiometry in the feasibility and efficiency of biomass conversions. The impact of hydrogen supply and its energy cost in improving conversion efficiency is also underlined. In terms of biomass conversion results, microalgae provide better conversion efficiency than lignocellulosic biomass. For these reactions, an optimal carbon conversion ratio is identified. The optimum conversion ratios are about 36%–46% for short chains such as methane or methanol and 64%–75% for long chains.\n",

      "To estimate the hydrogen mobility of coal and solvent quantitatively, reactions of tetralin, decalin and 1-methylnaphthalene with tritiated gaseous hydrogen in the absence and presence of Wandoan coal were performed under conditions generally used for coal liquefaction: 300–400°C, initial H2 pressure 5.9 MPa. Tritium in the gas phase was transferred to coal and solvent mainly through hydrogen exchange and slight hydrogen addition. The amount of hydrogen exchanged between the gas phase, coal and solvents was estimated from hydrogen and tritium balances. At 400°C and 120 min, coal conversion in the presence of tetralin, decalin and 1-methylnaphthalene was 87, 45 and 54%, respectively. Under these conditions, the amount of hydrogen exchanged between the gas phase and coal decreased in the order 1-methylnaphthalene (1.38 g 30 g−1 of coal) > tetralin (0.85 g 30 g−1 of coal) > decalin (0.72 g 30 g−1 of coal). Compared with the amount of hydrogen exchanged, the amount of hydrogen added from the gas phase to the coal was smaller than 0.07 g in each solvent. Coal hydrogen exchange reactions in the presence of tetralin or decalin were similar to those in the absence of solvent. On the contrary, remarkable hydrogen exchange with coal in the presence of 1-methylnaphthalene occurred with a rise from 350 to 400°C. Further, a significant amount of 1-methylnaphthalene decomposed to naphthalene and methane in this temperature range, while hydrogen addition from 1-methylnaphthalene to coal did not occur. This suggests that hydrogen exchange reactions among the gas phase, coal and 1-methylnaphthalene proceeded by radical chain mechanisms, with the supply of radicals from coal.\n",

      "Nowadays, the development of fuel cell is getting more and more inseparable from the production of hydrogen. Long‐chain hydrocarbons steam reforming is a feasible way for hydrogen supply. Herein, various nickel‐ceria‐praseodymium (Ni‐Ce‐Pr) catalysts have been prepared by a sol‐gel method. Multiple parameters during catalyst preparation, including the amount of Ni, the content of doped Pr and the calcination temperature, were systematically studied for tuning the catalytic performance for n‐dodecane steam reforming in a fixed‐bed reactor under 15 mL/gcat·h at 600°C and water‐to‐carbon molar ratio of 2 at 0.1 MPa. Reaction data showed that both the amount of Ni and the content of doped Pr will greatly affect the n‐dodecane conversion and hydrogen production. Additionally, the calcination temperature during catalyst preparation showed a big influence on its performance for n‐dodecane steam reforming. After optimization, 10Ni‐CePr2‐600 exhibits the highest activity and stability for n‐dodecane steam reforming, accompanying with the lowest rate of coke deposition (0.015 gc/gcat·h). The structure and oxygen vacancy of the catalyst was characterized by H2‐TPR, Raman, and X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The superior activity and stability of 10Ni‐CePr2‐600 are ascribed to the strong interaction between NiO and support along with abundant oxygen vacancies in the Pr‐doped ceria. Catalytic steam reforming of long‐chain hydrocarbons has drawn great attention for hydrogen production, which can be used for on‐board/on‐site fuel cell. Novel catalysts of Ni‐based solid oxides with high activity and stability for steam reforming of n‐dodecane have been developed. After optimization of catalytic performance, the catalyst of 10Ni‐CePr2‐600 showed high hydrogen production with the almost rate of 6453.5 μmol/min in 600°C at water to carbon ratio of 2.\n",

Therefore, in this paper, a comparative assessment between the total (cT) and non-renewable (cNR) unit exergy costs and specific CO2 emissions (cCO2) of the electricity, methane and hydrogen produced from sugarcane vinasse and bagasse is presented and compared with the conventional (fossil fuel-based) supply chains. As a result, the non-renewable unit exergy costs and specific CO2 emissions for the transportation service in all cases analysed are 3.1 to 4.7 times lower compared with conventional fossil fuels (e.g., diesel, gasoline, natural gas and hydrogen). Among the waste upgrade alternatives, methane production is able to maximise the exergy flow rate of products in the transformation stage (52.4-58.6 MW), while hydrogen and electricity production can substantially increase the transportation service in the end-use stage (51.7-52.1%) and the operational revenues (2,706-2,889 EUR/h).\n",

      "The approach of fossil fuel substitution requires alternative strategies in the progressing sector coupling of energy storage, distribution and conversion. Promising solutions are flexibly supply chain models of green and blue hydrogen which is fed into the natural gas network (HNG). Prerequisite for a successful implementation is the functional capability of end-use applications for which different volumetric hydrogen thresholds are documented in literature. A clear research gap is thereby evident for HNG fired medium-speed large-bore gas engines typical used for stationary power generation. For solving this problem, generic single cylinder tests with focus on operating window, NOx formation and hydro-carbon emissions have been carried out. The results are analysed and compared to available publications of HNG fired high-speed gas engines to derive general insights of the combustion characteristics. Under rising blending share, an in literature described, general shifting of the possible operating window and an increase of NOx formation are detected. In terms of unburned hydrocarbons, a NOx-neutral reduction potential through hydrogen blending is only visible under very lean operating conditions. This result deviates from expected literature values of high-speed engine setups. The experimental study demonstrates the NOx neutral combustion capability of medium-speed large-bore gas engines under 20% hydrogen admixture.\n",

      " \n",
      "Aerobic oxidation of short-chain alkanes was observed in gas samples from the Lutao intertidal hydrothermal vents in Taiwan, during storage at 20 °C for up to 29 months without adding bacterial strains and replenishing substrates. The carbon isotope fractionation factors (ε C) of methane (C1), ethane (C2), and propane (C3), were calculated using the Rayleigh fractionation equation to be −37.1 ± 7.5‰, −14.8 ± 4.8‰, and −4.7 ± 5.2‰, respectively. The hydrogen isotope fractionation factor (ε H) of methane was determined to be −281 ± 187‰. DNA sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene in the vent fluids suggests that aerobic oxidation is dominated by methanotrophs of the genera Methylomicrobium and Methylophaga, which use the ribulose monophosphate pathway (RuMP). The degrees of isotope fractionation (ε C and ε H values) herein are larger than previously reported values, possibly due to the limited O2 supply and low abundance of aerobic methane-oxidizing bacteria in the experiments. Since the fractionation factor of methane is higher than those of ethane and propane, the aerobic oxidation of thermogenic or microbial alkanes could produce a carbon isotope reversal, which is frequently noted as a trait of abiotic hydrocarbons. This work demonstrates that in addition to anaerobic microbial oxidation, aerobic oxidation with a low cell density can also produce significant isotope fractionation of alkanes in geological closed/semi-closed environments and open flow reaction systems that are characterized by moderate temperatures and a limited supply of substrates and O2; these environments include cold seeps, mud volcanoes, and low-temperature hydrothermal plumes/aquifers/reservoirs.\n",

This is shown by the distribution of the 16:1(n-7) and 20:5(n-3) fatty acids indicative for diatoms, and the excellent correlation with the chlorophyll a concentrations in the surface water masses and the biogenic-opal content and increased hydrogen indices of the sediments. The high concentration of these unsaturated fatty acids in shallow water sediments shows the recent deposition of the organic material. In deep-sea sediments, on the other hand, the concentrations are low. This decreased content is typical for phytoplankton material which has been degraded by microorganisms or autoxidation. In general, the alkenone concentrations are very low, suggesting low production rates by prymnesiophytes. Only at one station from the lower continental margin influenced by the inflow of Atlantic water masses, were some higher amounts of alkenones determined. Long-chain n-alkanes as well as high C/N ratios and low hydrogen indices indicate the importance of (fluvial) supply of terrigenous organic matter.\n",

      "Recently, important efforts have been made to define food loss management strategies. Most strategies have mainly been focused on mass and energy recovery through mixed food loss in centralised recovery models. This work aims to highlight the need to address a decentralised food loss management, in order to manage the different fractions and on each of the different stages of the food supply chain. For this purpose, an energy flow analysis is made, through the calculation of the primary energy demand of four stages and 11 food categories of the Spanish food supply chain in 2015. The energy efficiency assessment is conducted under a resource use perspective, using the energy return on investment (EROI) ratio, and a circular economy perspective, developing an Energy return on investment – Circular economy index (EROIce), based on a food waste-to-energy-to-food approach. Results suggest that the embodied energy loss consist of 17% of the total primary energy demand, and related to the food categories, the vegetarian diet appears to be the most efficient, followed by the pescetarian diet. Comparing food energy loss values with the estimated energy provided for one consumer, it is highlighted the fact that the food energy loss generated by two to three persons amounts to one person's total daily intake. Moreover, cereals is the category responsible for the highest percentage on the total food energy loss (44%); following by meat, fish and seafood and vegetables. When the results of food energy loss and embodied energy loss are related, it is observed that categories such as meat and fish and seafood have a very high primary energy demand to produce less food, besides that the parts of the food supply chain with more energy recovery potential are the beginning and the end. Finally, the EROIce analysis shows that in the categories of meat, fish and seafood and cereals, anaerobic digestion and composting is the best option for energy recovery. From the results, it is discussed the possibility to developed local digesters at the beginning and end of the food supply chain, as well as to developed double digesters installations for hydrogen recovery from cereals loss, and methane recovery from mixed food loss.\n",

      "Hydrogen is increasingly becoming an important element in the quest for clean energy and pollution free transport and this investigation concentrates on one aspect of the hydrogen supply chain which is its production. This work reviews current methods for production of hydrogen and discusses the negative impacts of methods that depend on fossil material to produce hydrogen. The work then reviews the technologies for production of hydrogen using water electrolysis as a clean source of hydrogen production utilising energy from renewables with strong emphasis on the use of polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) electrolytic cells. The components of PEM electrolyser cell are analysed and their impact on the cell operations are examined. The work discusses the performance of PEM electrolysers and examines the different challenges that face the development of these cells components and the effect of operational conditions on cell construction materials and their longevity. The work analyse published research that discusses the impact cells material deterioration has on cell performance and deviation from optimum operational conditions. Degradation effects at varying operational conditions are discussed along with some mitigation strategies that can be used to improve cells durability and efficiency. This includes the material composition of components in the electrolyser that contribute significantly to the overall efficiency of the cell. The work concludes by suggesting areas for further research to help improve the competitiveness of PEM cells electrolysers.\n",

      " \n",
      "In this study, the authors developed an Optimal Power Generation Mix model, which takes into account the supply chain of imported and domestically produced hydrogen, also modeling the intermittency of renewable energy at a 10-min resolution, and applied it to the case of Japan, to investigate quantitatively the possibility of achieving zero emission in 2050. Even if the costs of wind and solar PV decline drastically towards 2050 and the huge potentials that have been assumed in the literature are realized, the total system costs escalate significantly with very high shares of intermittent renewables. Since the use of hydrogen produced by excess electricity from renewable power generation sources can only make a slight contribution to reducing this escalation, it would be invaluable to introduce at least a significant amount of electricity generated by “zero-emission thermal power” technologies, including CO2-free imported hydrogen or conventional thermal power generation with carbon capture and sequestration (CCS). Nuclear power is also estimated as being effective in reducing the cost hike associated with achieving zero emissions. The results of this study could contribute to giving insights regarding global deployment of hydrogen-related technologies, as well as to presenting a frame of reference for Japan's future energy policies.\n",

      "Hydrogen fueled fuel cell vehicles (FCVs) will play a major role as a part of the change toward the hydrogen based energy system. When combined with the right source of energy, fuel cells have the highest potential efficiencies and lowest potential emissions of any vehicular power source. As a result, extensive work into the development of hydrogen fueled FCVs is taking place. The aim of this paper is to highlight some of the research and development work which has occurred in the past five years on fuel cell vehicle technology, with a focus on economic and environmental concerns. It is observed that the current efforts are divided up into several parts. The performance, durability, and cost of fuel cell technology continue to be improved, and some fuel cells are currently ready to be mounted on vehicles and tested. Environmental and economic assessments of the entire hydrogen supply chain, including fuel cell end-use, are being carried out by groups of researchers around the world. It is currently believed that fuel cells need at least five more years of testing and improvement before large scale commercialization can begin. Economic and environmental analyses show that FCVs will likely be both economically competitive and environmentally benign. Indeed, the transition of the transportation sector to the use of hydrogen FCVs will represent one of the biggest steps toward the hydrogen economy.\n",

      "10.1155/2016/5127682\n",
      " \n",
      "The role of hydrogen bond molecule clustering in laminar burning velocities was observed. The water in hydrous ethanol can change the interaction between water-ethanol molecules. A certain amount of water can become oxygenated which increases the burning velocity. The hydrogen bond interaction pattern of ethanol and water molecules was modeled. Based on the molecular model, azeotropic behavior emerges from ethanol-water hydrogen bond, which is at a 95.1%v composition. The interaction with water molecule causes the ethanol molecule to be clustered with centered oxygenated compound. So, it supplies extra oxygen and provides intermolecular empty spaces that are easily infiltrated by the air. In the azeotropic composition, the molecular bond chain is the shortest, so hypothetically the burning velocity is anticipated to increase. The laminar burning velocity of ethanol fuel was tested in a cylindrical explosion bomb in lean, stoichiometric, and rich mixtures. The experimental result showed that the maximum burning velocity occurred at hydrous ethanol of 95.5%v composition. This discrepancy is the result of the addition of energy from 7.7% free ethanol molecules that are not clustered. At the rich mixture, the burning velocity of this composition is higher than that of anhydrous ethanol.\n",

      "A few months ago, I read an online report that said \"Automakers are all investing heavily in what they think will be the next big breakthrough in cars, emission-free fuel cells. These fuel cells, which run on hydrogen and produce nothing but water vapor, are expected to power a new generation of cars that will free the world from reliance on oil.\" Many of us have read similar news clips or seen equivalent television coverage. If only it were so easy. Remember, there's no such thing as a free lunch. Everything has some kind of environmental impact. If a sunbeam is deflected from its previous path or if water is diverted, something changes. The issue is whether, in the grand scope of things, society finds the cost/benefit ratio of the change to be acceptable. To compare different methods of powering transportation, the correct approach is to look at the full life cycle and to compare all the options on a common basis. Evaluation of everything involved in all the components that lead to the end product is a huge undertaking, so usually the comparison focuses on specific aspects—for example, the fuel supply chain. The differences in the emissions associated with manufacturing different components of the vehicle—for example, fuel cells or batteries as opposed to an internal combustion engine—are not included. In the example quoted, the hydrogen fuel-cell vehicle is like an electric vehicle. It is not a zero-emission vehicle when evaluated on a full life-cycle basis, but rather a remote-emission vehicle. Just as the emissions associated with an electric vehicle depend on the source of the electricity, the emissions involved in use of hydrogen depend upon how the hydrogen is generated. On earth, hydrogen is almost always found in combination with other elements, as for example in water. Therefore, it is more appropriate to view hydrogen not as an energy source, like hydrocarbons, but rather as an energy carrier, like electrons. Decarbonization of the energy supply may lead us not to a hydrogen economy, but to an electron economy. With current technology, the most cost-effective method of producing hydrogen is from natural gas and water at high temperatures in catalytic reactors using a process called steam reforming. The hydrogen is subsequently further purified to minimize damage to fuel-cell membranes from contaminants. Worldwide, extensive research is underway to produce hydrogen from renewable sources on a cost-competitive basis, but additional technical breakthroughs are needed to achieve that goal.\n",

      "International shipping faces strong challenges with new legally binding air quality regulations and a 50% decarbonisation target by 2050. Liquefied natural gas (LNG) is a widely used alternative to liquid fossil fuels, but methane emissions reduce its overall climate benefit. This study utilises new emissions measurements and supply-chain data to conduct a comprehensive environmental life cycle and cost assessment of LNG as a shipping fuel, compared to heavy fuel oil (HFO), marine diesel oil (MDO), methanol and prospective renewable fuels (hydrogen, ammonia, biogas and biomethanol). LNG gives improved air quality impacts, reduced fuel costs and moderate climate benefits compared to liquid fossil fuels, but with large variation across different LNG engine types. Methane slip from some engines is unacceptably high, whereas the best performing LNG engine offers up to 28% reduction in global warming potential when combined with the best-case LNG supply chain. Total methane emissions must be reduced to 0.8–1.6% to ensure climate benefit is realised across all timescales compared to current liquid fuels. However, it is no longer acceptable to merely match incumbent fuels; progress must be made towards decarbonisation targets. With methane emissions reduced to 0.5% of throughput, energy efficiency must increase 35% to meet a 50% decarbonisation target.\n",

      "10.1002/aocs.12375\n",
      " \n",
      "An alternative route to the conventional one for fatty alcohol synthesis was investigated. It was possible to synthesize lauryl alcohol from methyl laurate via reduction by transfer of hydrogen and hydride in liquid phase, in noncatalytic reactions and without the supply of H2 gaseous. Pure NaBH4 or alumina‐supported NaBH4 and methanol were used as co‐reactants and 100% fatty alcohol selectivities were achieved. The aim of supporting the metal hydride was to increase its stability and achieve the full recovery of the solid at the end of reaction. When alumina‐supported NaBH4 was used, a final fatty alcohol yield of 93% was achieved. The use of methanol and NaBH4 in amounts higher than stoichiometric is important to generate alkoxyborohydride anions which act as better reducing species than NaBH4. The reaction conditions effect was investigated and the role of short carbon chain alcohol structure was elucidated. The effect of fatty acid methyl ester structure was also studied. Fatty acid methyl esters with shorter carbon chain length and without unsaturation (methyl laurate, methyl myristate) were easily reduced using NaBH4/Al2O3 and methanol reaching high conversions and fatty alcohol selectivities. Unsaturated fatty acid methyl ester with longer carbon chain (methyl oleate) introduced steric hindrance which disfavoured interaction between ester and reducing solid surface and fatty acid methyl ester conversion was noticeably lower. A reaction mechanism based on alkoxyborohydride anions as the actual reducing species was proposed. This mechanism fully interprets results obtained during fatty acid methyl ester reduction using short carbon chain alcohols and metal hydride.\n",

      "Electricity, hydrogen—What they have in common, where they are unique.Electricity and hydrogen have in common that they are secondary energies which can be generated from any primary energy (raw materials). Once generated they are environmentally and climatically clean along the entire length of their respective energy conversion chains. Both electricity and hydrogen are grid delivered (with exceptions); they are interchangeable via electrolysis and fuel cell. Both are operational worldwide, although in absolutely dissimilar capacities. And their peculiarities? Electricity stores and transports information, hydrogen does not. Hydrogen stores and transports energy, electricity transports energy but does not store it (in large quantities). For long (i.e., continental) transport routes, hydrogen has advantages. The electricity sector is part of the established energy economy. Hydrogen, on the other hand, takes two pathways: one where it has been in use materially in the hydrogen economy almost since its discovery in the later 18th century; today, it is traded worldwide as a commodity up to an amount of some 50million tonnes p.a., e.g., in methanol or ammonia syntheses, for fat hardening in the food industry, as a cleansing agent in glass or electronics manufacturing, and the like. And along the other pathway it serves as an energy carrier in the up coming hydrogen energy economy which started with the advent of the space launching business after WW II. Essentially, the hydrogen energy economy deals with the introduction of the, after electricity, now second major secondary energy carrier, hydrogen, together with its conversion technologies, e.g., fuel cells, into portable electronic equipment such as television cameras, laptops, cellular phones, etc., into the distributed stationary electricity and heat supply in the capacity range of kilowatts to megawatts, and into transport vehicles on earth, at sea, in the air, or space-borne. It is never a question of the energy carrier alone, be it either hydrogen or hydrogen reformat. On the contrary, environmentally and climatically clean hydrogen energy technologies along the entire length of the energy conversion chain, from production via storage, transport and distribution to, finally, end use, are what is of overarching importance. Of course, technologies are not energies, but they are as good as energies. Efficient energy technologies provide more energy services from less primary energy (raw materials). Energy efficiency gains are energies! Especially for energy poor, but technology-rich countries, efficiency gains compare well to indigenous energy sources! The trend is clearly visible: increasingly, the world is moving from national fuels to global fuels, and energy technologies serve as their opening valves. CO2 capture and sequestration technologies bring hydrogen-dependent clean fossil fuels to life, and hydrogen supported fuel cell technology activates dormant virtual distributed power. Both technologies are key for the hydrogen energy economy which, thus, becomes the linchpin of future world energy.\n",

      "The transportation sector has been the largest contributor to emissions and pollution in Canada. Climate and public health have been negatively affected by the consumption of fossil fuels by conventional vehicles. The rollout of fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) has not yet occurred due to a conundrum. Specifically, a refueling infrastructure is required for the mass deployment of FCEVs, but the commercialization of FCEVs is required for investments, thus leading to the question of which will be required first, vehicle commercialization or hydrogen refueling stations. This paper develops a multi-objective model to determine the optimal sizes and locations of the hydrogen infrastructure needed to generate and distribute hydrogen for the key Highway Corridor (HWY 401) in Ontario. The model is used to aid the early-stage transition plan for the conversion of conventional vehicles to FCEVs in Ontario by proposing a feasible solution to the infrastructure dilemma posed by the initial adoption of hydrogen as fuel in the general market. The health benefit from the pollution reduction is also determined to show the potential social and economic incentives of using FCEVs. The results show that hydrogen production and delivery cost can reduce from $22.7/kg H2 in a 0.1% market share scenario to $14.7/kg H2 in a 1% market share scenario. The environmental and health benefit of developing hydrogen refueling infrastructure for heavy-duty vehicles is 1.63 million dollar per year and 1.45 million dollars per year, respectively. Also, every kilogram of H2 can avoid 11.09 kg CO2 from entering the atmosphere. In a 1% market share scenario, proposed hydrogen network avoids more than 37,000 tonnes CO2 per year.\n",

      "Liquid air has recently emerged as a new energy vector that has the ability to reserve considerable amounts of renewable energy as both cold and power. Liquid air used for energy storage and transportation has gained increasing attention in both academia and industry, owing to its high flexibility, free availability, and potential high cost-efficiency. Supported by an existing established cryogenic transportation network, liquid air can be an intermediate between conventional fossil fuels and green hydrogen, allowing a smooth and reliable transition towards a 100% renewable energy system. This review offers an overview of previous and emerging liquid air technologies and highlights the potential of liquid air for energy recovery and production from a multi-scale systems perspective (molecular, process, system, and supply chain). Emphasis is placed on how liquid air participates in the current energy system transition and assists in the efficient use and management of both renewable energy and waste energy derived from industries. The review covers a range of technologies, such as air liquefaction and liquid air energy extraction cycles, liquid air energy storage, air separation units, and liquid air supply chains, with a focus on identifying and organizing influential factors to construct energy- and cost-efficient liquid air energy systems. To establish a future liquid air economy, challenges and opportunities are outlined in terms of multi-scale systems design and optimization, liquid air flexibility, and system real-time scheduling and planning to balance power supply and demand while improving the techno-economics for feasible industrial implementation.\n",

      "Australia is in a bind. It is at the heart of the pivot to clean energy: it contains some of the world’s best solar irradiance and vast potential for large-scale carbon capture and storage; it showed the world the path forward with its stationary storage flexibility at the much vaunted Hornsdale power reserve facility; and it moved quickly to capitalise on low-carbon hydrogen production. Yet it remains one of the largest sources for carbon-intensive energy exports in the world. The extractive industries are still delivering thermal coal for power generation and metallurgical coal for carbon-intensive steel making in Asian markets. Even liquefied natural gas’s green credentials are being questioned. Are these two pathways compatible? The treasury and economy certainly benefit. But there is a huge opportunity to redress the source of those funds and jobs, while fulfilling the aspirations to reach net zero emissions by 2050. In our estimates, the low-carbon hydrogen economy could grow to become so substantial that 15% of all energy may be ultimately ‘carried’ by hydrogen by 2050. It is certainly needed to keep the world from breaching 2°C. Can Australia master the hydrogen trade? It is believed that it has a very good chance. Blessed with first-mover investment advantage, and tremendous solar and wind resourcing, Australia is already on a pathway to become a producer of green hydrogen below US$2/kg by 2030. How might it then construct a supply chain to compete in the international market with established trading partners and end users ready to renew old acquaintances? Its route is assessed to mastery of the hydrogen trade, analyse critical competitors for end use and compare costs with other exporters of hydrogen.\n",

      "Hydrogen will assume a key role in Europe's effort to adopt its energy dependent society to satisfy its needs without releasing vast amounts of greenhouse gases. The paradigm shift is so paramount that one speaks of the “Hydrogen Economy”, as the energy in this new and ecological type of economy is to be distributed by hydrogen. However, H2 is not a primary energy source but rather an energy carrier, a means of storing, transporting and distributing energy, which has to be generated by other means.Various H2 storage methods are possible; however industries' favourite is the storage of gaseous hydrogen in high pressure tanks. The biggest promoter of this storage methodology is the automotive industry, which is currently preparing for the generation change from the fossil fuel internal combustion engines to hydrogen based fuel cells. The current roadmaps foresee a market roll-out by 2015, when the hydrogen supply infrastructure is expected to have reached a critical mass. The hydrogen economy is about to take off as being demonstrated by various national mobility strategies, which foresee several millions of electric cars driving on the road in 2020.Fuel cell cars are only one type of “electric car”, battery electric as well as hybrid cars – all featuring electric drive trains – are the others. Which type of technology is chosen for a specific application depends primarily on the involved energy storage and power requirements. These considerations are very similar to the ones in the aerospace sector, which had introduced the fuel cell already in the 1960s. The automotive sector followed only recently, but has succeeded in moving forward the technology to a level, where the aerospace sector is starting considering to spin-in terrestrial hydrogen technologies into its technology portfolio. Target areas are again high power/high energy applications like aviation, manned spaceflight and exploration missions, as well as future generation high power telecommunication satellites. Similar trends can be expected in the future for RADAR Earth Observation satellites and space infrastructure concepts of great scale.This paper examines current activities along the hydrogen value chain, both in the terrestrial and the aerospace sector. A general assessment of the synergy potential is complemented by a thorough analysis of specific applications serving as role models like a lunar manned base or pressurised rover, an aircraft APU or a high power telecommunications satellite. Potential performance improvements and cost savings serve as key performance indicators in these comparisons and trade-offs.\n",

      "Interaction of organic polymer surfaces with energetic reactive ions during etching processes by hydrogen–nitrogen plasmas has been investigated microscopically with the use of classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Especially examined in the present study are interactions of atomic-nitrogen, molecular-nitrogen, or ammonia beams with a polyparaphenylene (PPP) surface and the resulting surface modification. It has been observed in the simulations that, when reactive atomic-nitrogen (N) beams are injected into a PPP surface, a carbon nitride layer with carbon–nitrogen bonds of higher bond orders (i.e., bonds containing π bonds) tend to be formed and it also acts as a source of carbon-nitride clusters for sputtered species. This observation is consistent with the fact that excessive supply of nitrogen to a carbon nitride film makes the film structurally weak as nitrogen atoms tend to break up carbon chains. On the other hands, when ammonia (NH3) beams are injected, carbon–nitrogen single bonds (i.e., σ bonds only) are more likely to be formed since hydrogen atoms would efficiently terminate π bonds should they be formed.\n",

Three of the four species show quite higher total concentrations of n-alkanes in the relatively dry non-peatland setting than in the peatland. In addition, the δ2H values of long-chain n-alkanes are generally less depleted in the peatland and are comparable among different plant species, which is interpreted as the influence of inundation condition and the possible limited supply of photosynthetic products. This study reveals different patterns of plant wax molecular and isotopic compositions between peatland and the surrounding non-peatland conditions, and confirms the paleoenvironmental potential of leaf wax ratios on the peat sequences.\n",

The nation's current transportation system of systems (SoS) relies almost exclusively on refined petroleum products, accounting for over two-thirds of the oil used in the United States each day.

In the long term, a potential solution to the nation's transportation energy problems is an operational hydrogen-based transportation economy. Transitioning to any alternative transportation fuel on a national scale will require the creation of a robust and cost-effective system of systems that operates in concert with the dynamics of today's mature and highly-networked transportation infrastructure.

In this work, two-dimensional CFD study is carried out to explore an enhancement on MSR thermal behavior. Two configurations in terms of catalyst coating are investigated. The first MSR configuration is equipped with continuous catalytic layer, while in the second, discrete catalyst layers separated by an inert gap are imposed. The effect of the catalyst patterning on the thermal and mass behavior of MSR is discussed. The results show that the MSR efficiency can be improved by extending the catalytic zone and discretizing the catalyst coating. Comparing to conventional MSR with continuous catalytic layers, enhancement of 28.71% in CH4 conversion and 88.574% in H2 production is realized by using discretized catalytic layers.\n",

A major factor in achieving this goal is transitioning to renewable fuels. This implies a challenge, as not only ship-innovative solutions but also a complete low-carbon fuel supply chain must be implemented.

Several aspects including vessel sizes, impact of weather and shipping routes, emissions savings and costs are considered. The local energy use is determined with proven bottom-up prediction methods based on ship positioning data from the Automatic Identification System (AIS) in combination with weather and ship technical data. This methodology was extended by an approach to the generation of a basic low-carbon fuel system topology that enables the consideration of local demand profiles. The applicability of the proposed approach is discussed at hand via a case study on Roll-on/Roll-off passenger and cargo (RoPax) ferries transitioning from conventional fuels to a compressed hydrogen fuel system. The results indicate a potential reduction in emissions by up to 95% and possible system sizes and costs.\n",

      "10.1111/1365-2435.13981\n",
      " \n",
      "Organisms at the base of aquatic food webs synthesize essential nutrients, such as omega‐3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n‐3 PUFA), which are transferred to consumers at higher trophic levels. Many consumers, requiring n‐3 long‐chain (LC) PUFA, such as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), have limited ability to biosynthesize them from the essential dietary precursor α‐linolenic acid (ALA) and thus rely on dietary provision of LC‐PUFA. We investigated LC‐PUFA metabolism in freshwater zooplankton using stable hydrogen isotopes (δ2H) of fatty acids as tracers. We conducted feeding experiments with the freshwater keystone grazer Daphnia to quantify changes in the δ2H value of body FA in response to the FA composition of their food and the δ2H value of the ambient water. The isotopic composition of LC‐PUFA changed in Daphnia, depending on the integration of 2H from ambient water during de novo synthesis or bioconversion from dietary precursors, allowing us to distinguish dietary from bioconverted EPA in body tissue. We tested the applicability of these laboratory findings in a field setting by analysing δ2H values of PUFA in primary producers and consumers in eutrophic ponds to track EPA sources of zooplankton. Multilinear regression models that included conversion of ALA to EPA correlated better with zooplankton δ2HEPA than seston δ2HEPA at low dietary EPA supply. This study provides evidence that zooplankton can compensate for low dietary EPA supply by activating LC‐PUFA biosynthesis and shows that herbivorous zooplankton play a crucial role in upgrading FA for higher trophic levels during low dietary EPA supply.

      " \n",
      "This study examines the potential change in primary emissions and energy use from replacing the current U.S. fleet of fossil-fuel on-road vehicles (FFOV) with hybrid electric fossil fuel vehicles or hydrogen fuel cell vehicles (HFCV). Emissions and energy usage are analyzed for three different HFCV scenarios, with hydrogen produced from: (1) steam reforming of natural gas, (2) electrolysis powered by wind energy, and (3) coal gasification. With the U.S. EPA's National Emission Inventory as the baseline, other emission inventories are created using a life cycle assessment (LCA) of alternative fuel supply chains. For a range of reasonable HFCV efficiencies and methods of producing hydrogen, we find that the replacement of FFOV with HFCV significantly reduces emission associated with air pollution, compared even with a switch to hybrids. All HFCV scenarios decrease net air pollution emission, including nitrogen oxides, volatile organic compounds, particulate matter, ammonia, and carbon monoxide. These reductions are achieved with hydrogen production from either a fossil fuel source such as natural gas or a renewable source such as wind. Furthermore, replacing FFOV with hybrids or HFCV with hydrogen derived from natural gas, wind or coal may reduce the global warming impact of greenhouse gases and particles (measured in carbon dioxide equivalent emission) by 6, 14, 23, and 1%, respectively. Finally, even if HFCV are fueled by a fossil fuel such as natural gas, if no carbon is sequestered during hydrogen production, and 1% of methane in the feedstock gas is leaked to the environment, natural gas HFCV still may achieve a significant reduction in greenhouse gas and air pollution emission over FFOV.\n",

      " \n",
      "We have prepared high mobility n-type conductive hybridized carbon films with microstructures dominantly comprising of ultrananocrystalline diamond (UNCD) and graphene nanoribbons (GNR) via oxygen ion (O+) implantation and thermal oxidization annealing. The results indicate that GNRs appear in the grain boundaries of 1011–1013 cm−2 O+-implanted hybridized carbon films after 800–900 °C annealing. The O+-implanted diamond grains terminated by CO bonds give conductivity and GNRs construct a conductive network surrounding diamond grains, thus n-type Hall mobility attains to high values of 126–303 cm2 V−1 s−1. The results of Raman spectra, high resolution transmission electron microscopy and near edge X-ray absorption fine structure show that the contents of trans-polyacetylene chains decrease while GNRs appear in grain boundaries. It means that some trans-polyacetylene chains transit to GNRs. The calculation by using first-principles based nudged elastic band method determines a low activation barrier value of 0.87 eV for the transition from trans-polyacetylene chains to GNRs, confirming that GNRs are originated from the fact that two trans-polyacetylene chains approach to connect each other accompanied by the hydrogen desorption in the chains. Our results supply a novel hybridized carbon films which can be applied in the areas of electronic devices, field emission displayer and electrochemical electrodes.\n",

Lack of scaled, cost-effective environmentally-friendly methods of hydrogen generation and infrastructure is becoming a major challenge for widespread adoption of hydrogen for transportation, energy grid, integration with chemical processes, and plants. Water electrolysis (WE) method of hydrogen generation and its integration into infrastructure is therefore rapidly gaining industrial interest all around the world. This talk will focus on the separator membrane challenges in PEM WE systems and how novel, composite membranes can help the development and scale up of high efficiency, low total-cost-of-ownership systems. Applying the fundamental knowledge generated in fuel cell research with further tailoring of material properties to the needs of WE generated membranes with the thickness in the range of 50 micron that can withstand more than 400psi differential pressure, while possessing only half of the proton resistance of an archetypical benchmark N115. These advancements enable high pressure, high current density operation of a WE system. We will also discuss how Gore leverages its fuel cell platform with robust supply chain developed over last 20 years for the scale-up of these novel WE PEM composites.\n",

      "This review paper examines the key barriers to using green ammonia as an alternative fuel in maritime industry. A literature survey is performed based on research articles and grey literature, with the aim of discussing the technoeconomic problems with and benefits of ammonia and the relevant technologies. The limitations of ammonia as a maritime fuel and its supply chain, the expected percentage demand by 2030 and 2050, its economic performance compared to other shipping fuels such as hydrogen, and the current regulations that may impact ammonia as a maritime fuel are discussed. There are several key barriers to ammonia’s wide adoption: (1) High production costs, due to the high capital costs associated with ammonia’s supply chain; (2) availability, specifically the limited geographical locations available for ammonia bunkering; (3) the challenge of ramping up current ammonia production; and (4) the development of ammonia-specific regulations addressing issues such as toxicity, safety, and storage. The general challenges involved with blue ammonia are the large energy penalty and associated operational costs, and a lack of technical expertise on its use. Regardless of the origin, for ammonia to be truly zero-carbon its whole lifecycle must be considered—a key challenge that will aid in the debate about whether ammonia holds promise as a zero-carbon maritime fuel.\n",

      "10.1016/j.renene.2021.08.030\n",
      " \n",
      "In situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and thermogravimetric analysis were conducted to characterise the co-pyrolysis of low-rank coal (SJC) and direct coal liquefaction residue (DCLR) as well as the evolution of the main functional groups of the pyrolysis products. This research is expected to further elucidate the reaction mechanism of co-pyrolysis. It was found that the co-pyrolysis of SJC and DCLR has synergistic effects and increases the hydrogen supply during co-pyrolysis. The chain breakage and thermal decomposition of functional groups during co-pyrolysis lead to the formation of solid, liquid, and gaseous products. The presence of DCLR promotes deep pyrolysis to produce numerous aromatic and aliphatic groups; many of these free-radical fragments rearrange and condense with hydrogen free radicals ([H]) to produce tar with a high molecular weight. When the [H] content is low, the free-radical fragments combine with each other to form solid coke. During co-pyrolysis, SJC and DCLR serve as both, hydrogen transmitters and donors. The catalysed hydrocraking of aromatic hydrocarbons and phenols in the tar product in the presence of hydrogen increases the content of the light component in the tar and produces alkanes, decreasing the aromatics and phenol contents.\n",

The applications are open to all fuel cells technologies, SOFC being mostly developed for the stationary applications, including back-up powers and APUs for transportation. Applications are also open to SOEC technologies where significant development have taken place in the last years. There are different groups working in Europe and supported partially by the FCH JU on the SOFC/SOEC technologies. Largely thanks to the FCH JU support, the EU is now a world leader on SOFC and SOEC technology with a well-established supply and value chain.

      " \n",
      "The green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is capable of photoproducing molecular hydrogen following sulphur deprivation, which results in anaerobiosis and a suppression of oxygen evolution and thus an alleviation of the inhibitory effect of oxygen on the hydrogenase. At the same time it transiently maintains a limited supply of electrons arising from photosystem II (PSII) to the hydrogenase (Melis and Happe Plant Physiol 2001; 127:740–748). In this work, using fast chl a fluorescence and P700 measurements, we show that ascorbate (Asc), a naturally occurring PSII alternative electron donor, is capable of donating electrons to PSII in heat-treated and sulphur-deprived cells and this can be significantly accelerated by supplementing the culture with 10 mM Asc. It also enhances, about three-fold, the photoproduction of hydrogen in cells subjected to sulphur deprivation as shown by gas chromatography. Similar stimulation was obtained in the presence of diphenylcarbazide (DPC), an artificial PSII electron donor. Asc and DPC also facilitated the anaerobiosis of cells, probably via super reducing the oxygen evolving complex while feeding electrons to PSII reaction centres and the linear electron transport chain, and ultimately to the hydrogenase – as shown by the significant DCMU-sensitivity of the light-induced Asc- and DPC-dependent re-reduction of P700+ and hydrogen evolution.\n",

Taking full advantage of low cost in the photovoltaic lifetime, the highway PV plant is supposed to be a promising, cheap power supply for new energy vehicles, and to conduce to less traditional energy consumption and carbon emission. (2) Two-level energy storage systems, including power-grid energy storage and customer-side energy storage, would be established by developing novel energy-storage devices, high-capacity materials of EV batteries and standardization of battery manufacturing. Also, with the aid of “internet of things (IOT)”, a network of monitoring, maintenance, recycling and echelon utilization will be established to cover the EV batteries’ whole life. (3) As for the new energy vehicles, novel manufacturing standards will be formulated including modular design and production. Instead of the integrated battery modules, the exchanging mode will be applied to vehicle batteries, accompanying with the construction of the gas-station-like battery supply network, which provides power access and battery charging/exchanging/maintenance. In addition, it is also briefly described that hydrogen evolves from water electrolysis by utilizing surplus photovoltaic and wind power and serves as a significant supplement of the present electricity-dominant renewable energy industry. An ecology is hopefully formed through synergetically developing renewable energy supply, storage and applications in the following years. Thereafter, the energy consumption will be thoroughly changed via the construction of a fossil-fuel-independent new energy eco-system, supported mainly by renewable energy sources.\n",

The hydrocarbon chain grows with participation of ethylene, which is formed in the argon medium directly from the ethanol molecule. Under these conditions, hydrogenation of this alkene on intermetallic clusters arising during the long-term reductive preactivation is suppressed. The alcohol supplies not only ethylene but also hydrogen. In the presence of Pd-Zn/Al2O3/MFI, ethanol is converted to alkanes and aromatic hydrocarbons according to independent pathways. Joint processing of alcohols and rapeseed oil in the presence of the Pd-Zn/Al2O3/MFI catalyst system is an efficient and promising route to C3-C11 hydrocarbons in the absence of an external source of hydrogen.\n",

      "There is an ongoing debate over future decarbonisation of gas networks using biomethane, and increasingly hydrogen, in gas network infrastructure. Some emerging research presents gas network decarbonisation options as a tractable alternative to ‘all-electric’ scenarios that use electric appliances to deliver the traditional gas services such as heating and cooking. However, there is some uncertainty as to the technical feasibility, cost and carbon emissions of gas network decarbonisation options. In response to this debate the Sustainable Gas Institute at Imperial College London has conducted a rigorous systematic review of the evidence surrounding gas network decarbonisation options. The study focuses on the technologies used to generate biomethane and hydrogen, and examines the technical potentials, economic costs and emissions associated with the full supply chains involved. The following summarises the main findings of this research. The report concludes that there are a number of options that could significantly decarbonise the gas network, and doing so would provide energy system flexibility utilising existing assets. However, these options will be more expensive than the existing gas system, and the GHG intensity of these options may vary significantly. In addition, more research is required, particularly in relation to the capabilities of existing pipework to transport hydrogen safely.\n",

      "Hydrogen liquefaction processes have effective function in the hydrogen supply chain. However low efficiency and high liquefaction costs are still the most important concerns about the liquefaction plants. In this study a new configuration for a hydrogen liquefier process is proposed and energy-exergy analyzed. The production rate of the liquid hydrogen ( L H 2 ) is 90 tons per day that can supply the required L H 2 of at least 90 k-180 k hydrogen vehicles in an urban area that results in the reduction of pollutions caused by carbon dioxide emission. The process is simulated in Aspen HYSYS simulator. In addition, it is optimized thorough a trial and error approach that is a functional and simple method of complicated systems analysis. The process includes a mixed refrigerant (MR) refrigeration cycle that precools feed gas hydrogen from 25 °C temperature to − 199.9 °C temperature. A new MR is used in a cascade Joule-Brayton cycle that deep-cools the low-temperature gaseous hydrogen from − 199.9 °C temperature to − 252.2 °C temperature in the cryogenic section of the plant. The novel process involves also an absorption refrigeration system (ARS) that cools some hydrogen streams in the precooling and cryogenic sections of the process. The consumed energy per kilogram of produced L H 2 is achieved as 6.47 k W h . This quantity is 2.89 k W h in the ideal conditions. The exergy efficiency of the plant is evaluated to be 45.5% that is significantly more than the exergy efficiency of the in operating hydrogen liquefiers in the world. The energy analysis reveals that the coefficient of performance (COP) of the overall system is 0.2034. The achieved COP is a higher amount in compare to the other similar processes. A sensitivity analysis is done to show the effect of the various operation conditions of the process on the features of the plant. Accordingly, the optimum mass flow of the ARS is determined as 207 k g / s for the proposed configuration. As well as, the effect of the change in the temperature approach of the heat exchangers and the changes in the adiabatic efficiency of the compressors and expanders on the SEC, COP, and the exergy efficiency of the overall plant is discussed. Furthermore, financial analysis of the plant estimates the capital expenditures (CAPEX), energy expenditures (EEX), and operational and maintenance expenditures (OMEX) as 25413 € 2000 , 7370 € 2000 , and 2033 € 2000 respectively. These can be specially improved be improving of the exergy efficiency of the plant. The results implicates that the proposed configuration has better performance indicators than the in-service liquefiers. Therefore, LHL plant manufacturer can be considered it in the design and development of new plants. As well as, researchers may utilize its operating conditions to improve the proposed processes.\n",

The latter are ambidentate ligands and supply by complex formation different sites of binding, sometimes cooperatively, in polyfunctional chains. This leads to the formation in nucleic acid macromolecules of different coordination centers, among them the unsaturated, deformed type: pure phosphate, mixed phosphate-base, pure base, crosslinked base, sandwich, complementary paired base and others. The probability of the centers is discussed.As a result of complex formation with nucleic acid macromolecules there are mutual influences between fuctional groups of the chain, those of electronic origin, conjugations, fields effects, dispersion interactions, hydrogen bonding, solvation, supermolecular structure formation and so on.

This study tests the notion that demand for alternative fuels will continue to increase as the transportation sector integrates cleaner fuels to comply with increasing environmental regulations. Using Qatar as a case study, linear programming was used to develop a mathematical model where several scenarios are assessed, and the optimal combination of fuels sold, and bunker fuel consumed is determined. Firstly, by looking for maximum profit given the constraints imposed; secondly, by looking for minimal greenhouse gas emissions under the same constraints; and thirdly, by looking for maximum profit and minimum environmental impact. Results demonstrate that cleaner fuels can reduce emissions of maritime industry. While solving for minimal emissions regardless of profit, outcomes suggest that LNG is the most favourable fuel to sell due to the high demand and high production capacity, whereas NH3 is the most favourable for fuelling ships. This solution yielded a significant reduction of CO2 emissions as opposed to that expected from HFO.\n",

      "The goal that the international community has set itself is to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the short/medium-term, especially in Europe that committed itself to reducing GHG emissions to 80–95% below 1990 levels by 2050. Renewable energies play a fundamental role in achieving this objective. In this context, the policies of the main industrialized countries of the world are being oriented towards increasing the shares of electricity produced from renewable energy sources (RES). In recent years, the production of renewable energy has increased considerably, but given the availability of these sources, there is a mismatch between production and demand. This raises some issues as balancing the electricity grid and, in particular, the use of surplus energy, as well as the need to strengthen the electricity network. Among the various new solutions that are being evaluated, there are: the accumulation in batteries, the use of compressed air energy storage (CAES) and the production of hydrogen that appears to be the most suitable to associate with the water storage (pumped hydro). Concerning hydrogen, a recent study highlights that the efficiencies of hydrogen storage technologies are lower compared to advanced lead acid batteries on a DC-to-DC basis, but “in contrast […] the cost of hydrogen storage is competitive with batteries and could be competitive with CAES and pumped hydro in locations that are not favourable for these technologies” (Moliner et al., 2016) [1]. This shows that, once the optimal efficiency rate is reached, the technologies concerning the production of hydrogen from renewable sources will be a viable and competitive solution. But, what will be the impact on the energy and fuel markets? The production of hydrogen through electrolysis will certainly have an important economic impact, especially in the transport sector, leading to the creation of a new market and a new supply chain that will change the physiognomy of the entire energy market.\n",

      "Salmonella is one of the most important causative agents of food borne infections in terms of food hygiene. In this study, we investigated whether N2 gas plasma, generated by applying a short high-voltage pulse to N2 using a static induction thyristor power supply (1.5 kilo pulse per second), exhibited a bactericidal/disinfecting effect against Salmonella. Viable cell number of Salmonella was efficiently decreased with a decimal reduction time (D value) of 0.178 min (initial slope) and 3.105 min (single-slope approximation). Plasma treatment altered the surface structure of Salmonella, as observed by scanning electron microscopy. In addition, this treatment induced a marked degradation in O antigen. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis also suggested that the Salmonella genomic DNA was damaged by the plasma treatment. Reactive chemical products (hydrogen peroxide-like chemicals), ultraviolet light (UV-A) and slight temperature elevations were observed during the operation of the gas plasma device. Viable cell number versus intensity of each potential bactericidal factor were used to identify the primary mechanism of disinfection of Salmonella. Although equivalent levels of UV-A or heat treatment did not inactivate Salmonella, treatment with a low concentration of hydrogen peroxide efficiently inactivated the bacteria. Our results suggest the N2 gas plasma generates reactive chemical species that alter components of Salmonella such as the cell surface as well as damaging the genomic DNA. The combined effect of these reactive species is to induce cell death.\n",

      "Europe is committed to a new growth strategy with no net greenhouse gases emissions by 2050, where hydrogen has a clear role to play. Portugal's strategy for H2 sets public policies promoting an industry focused on the hydrogen value chain. Considering the production of green hydrogen from renewable sources is key, water electrolysis becomes a priority, and with it, the need to assess the suitability of water sources, which is determined by both quantitative and qualitative factors. This work presents a new approach to assess the suitability of water sources for hydrogen production via water electrolysis by applying a Sustainable Value Methodology for decision-making support, combining economic, environmental and social criteria. The approach is applied to two different sites in Portugal: a semi-urban location on the Atlantic coast (site A) and a rural area far from the coast (site B). For both sites, water sources are evaluated regarding water availability, quality, transport options, abstraction costs, treatment needs and regulation (including environmental constraints) and social acceptance. The resulting sustainable value indicator, aggregator of different levels of information, enables a relative quantitative comparison of the performance of different water sources for electrolysis and the involved costs. It is found that the public grid water is the most suited source of water for electrolysis due to lower risk of supply, lower costs and avoids complex permitting processes. Likewise, seawater and wastewater treatment plant effluent (only in site A) showed to be possible water sources where the factors most affecting suitability are transport costs for water and waste disposal from water treatment.\n",

      "Petroleum products are produced as co-products of crude oil, and several kinds of petrochemical products are produced through petroleum-related products, where huge and complex supply chains exist. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) developed plans for reductions in air pollution in the international bunker under the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL) Convention, as well as requests for CO2 emission reductions under the Paris Agreement. In addition, automobiles are expected to reduce energy consumption and switch fuel sources from oil to electricity or hydrogen, for example. From the energy supply perspective, technological developments in hydrogen, biorefinery, and Carbon dioxide Capture and Utilization (CCU) are in progress, as well as the increasing trend for shale gas. This study consistently analyzes measures in the oil refinery and petrochemical sectors by using a global energy systems model considering these complex conditions. The SOx and NOx emission regulations by the IMO will have a large impact, and the additional global costs are estimated to be about 7–9 billion and 13-14 billion US$2000/year in the years 2030 and 2050, respectively. However, the long-term CO2 emission reduction constraints under the Paris Agreement will have much larger impacts on the oil refinery and petrochemical sectors, particularly after the middle of the 21st Century, and the impacts of SOx and NOx regulations will be relatively small. In order to meet the SOx and NOx regulations by the IMO, the countermeasures both of using high sulfur fuel oil with installing scrubbers etc. and switching to low sulfur fuel oil are cost-efficient. In the long term, liquified natural gas (LNG) and hydrogen, which also contribute to CO2 emission reductions, can be cost-efficient too.\n",

      "The restructuring of the energy supply towards renewable sources (wind, photovoltaics) will increase the volatility in power generation in future. In order to achieve a balance between supply and demand in the power grid, storage technologies are required, both short-term as well as long-term. The bidirectional link of the existing natural gas infrastructure with the power grid is enabled by the transformation of electric power in water electrolysis in a gaseous chemical energy carrier, hydrogen. Hydrogen can be admixed to the natural gas infrastructure (pipelines, gas reservoirs) in a limited amount, or can react with carbon dioxide and/or carbon monoxide in a catalytic reaction to methane. With the utilization of the natural gas infrastructure a release of the power grid as well as long-term energy storage are achieved. Another advantage of this “Power-to-Gas” technology is the use of CO2 emissions for the production of methane, and thus the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by CO2-recycling and the substitution of fossil sources.The actual research in the field of ”Power-to-Gas” deals with technological progress both in electrolysis as well as methanation, particularly to decrease investment costs. In terms of methanation, load flexible processes have to be developed which are adjusted to the fluctuating hydrogen production. The economic viability of the Power-to-Gas process chain can be increased by a synergetic link to existing industrial production. For example, an integrated steel plant offers a promising infrastructure, since carbon containing process gases are available in huge amounts, and oxygen as byproduct of the water electrolysis can be used directly. Such concepts facilitate an economically advantageous application of the Power-to-Gas technology in near future.\n",

      "Abstract Micro-patterned metal/ceramic model thin film electrodes were used to investigate the hydrogen oxidation mechanism on various metal/ion conductor combinations such as Ni/yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ), Pt/YSZ, Ni/scandia-stabilized zirconia, Ni/titania/YSZ. For all electrode types besides those with a continuous titania interlayer a triple phase boundary (TPB) and an area pathway could be separated. Moreover, activation energies as well as hydrogen and water reaction orders were determined for both pathways and compared with previously published data on Ni/YSZ. It was found that when varying the electronically conducting phases on YSZ the activation energy of the TPB path remains virtually the same. However, changing the ion conductor significantly influenced the activation energy, indicating a rate-limiting step on the electrolyte. However, the stark difference in water reaction order of Ni/YSZ and Pt/YSZ electrodes shows that the metal phase is also actively participating in the reaction chain. It is suggested that the electrolyte surface is responsible for the rate-limiting electrochemical redox reaction while the metal interacts with the gas phase molecules and thus supplies the reactants. For samples with a thin mixed conducting titania layer on YSZ, the electrochemical behavior drastically changed, which can be explained by an extension of the reaction zone away from the TPB.\n",

      " \n",
      "The Paris Agreement sets a clear target for net zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by the mid‐21st century. This implies that the transport sector has to reach zero GHG emissions mainly through direct and indirect electrification in the form of synthetic fuels, such as hydrogen and Fischer‐Tropsch (FT) fuels. The results of this research document that this very ambitious target is possible. This research analyses the global solar photovoltaics (PV) demand for achieving the Paris targets in the transport sector by the year 2050. The methodology is composed of the derivation of the transportation demand converted into final energy demand for direct electrification, hydrogen, methane, and FT‐fuels production. The power‐to‐gas (H2, CH4) and power‐to‐liquids (FT fuels) value chains are applied for the total electricity demand, which will be mostly fulfilled by PV, taking into account previous results concerning the renewable electricity share of the energy transition in the power sector for the world structured in 145 regions and results aggregated to nine major regions. The results show a continuous demand increase for all transportation modes till 2050. The total global PV capacity demand by 2050 for the transport sector is estimated to be about 19.1 TWp, thereof 35%, 25%, 7%, and 33% for direct electrification, hydrogen, synthetic natural gas, and FT fuels, respectively. PV will be the key enabler of a full defossilisation of the transport sector with a demand comparable with the power sector but a slightly later growth dynamic, leading to a combined annual PV capacity demand of about 1.8 TWp around 2050. This research presents for the first time the energy transition in the transport and power sectors towards 100% renewable energy based on full hourly resolution for an entire year and in 5‐year time steps till 2050 for the world structured in 145 regions. The averaged global PV supply share in the transport sector is derived to about 78% in the year 2050, which is the highest ever reported value. The high PV supply share in the transport sector is a consequence of a high overall direct and indirect electrification share of the transport sector to match the Paris Agreement and a high solar PV supply share in the power sector covering the electricity demand in the transport sector.\n",

      "The real penetration of renewable energy sources under random variability and unpredictability of weather conditions requires an optimal sizing of hybrid renewable power generation systems. This paper presents a techno-economic optimization model, to perform the optimal sizing of a stand-alone hybrid photovoltaic/wind/hydrogen/battery system. Optimum sizing has been applied to a system consisting of an induction motor coupled to a centrifugal pump, located at Sahline-Tunisia. The optimal-cost design and the new suitable power management approach are the two main objectives. The optimal sizing is assessed on the basis of technical (the Deficiency of Power Supply Probability, the Relative Excess Power Generated) and economic (the Energy Cost as well as the Total Net Present Cost) criteria. The power management strategy optimizes how the spare energy is used. The results highlight the important role of the hybridization of renewable energy sources, photovoltaic and wind turbine, in reducing the cost of the system. It is also noted that the hydrogen chain prolongs the life of the battery, preventing the massive use of the latter. The optimized sizing algorithm gives all the possible configurations of the hybrid system not only for a pumping system but also for any autonomous load located all over the world.\n",

      " \n",
      "Large-scale underground hydrogen storage (UHS) appears to play an important role in the hydrogen economy supply chain, hereby supporting the energy transition to net-zero carbon emission. To understand the movement of hydrogen plume at subsurface, hydrogen wettability of storage rocks has been recently investigated from the contact angles rock-H2-brine systems. However, hydrogen wettability of shale formations, which determines the sealing capacity of the caprock, has not been examined in detail. In this study, semi-empirical correlations were used to compute the equilibrium contact angles of H2/brine on five shale samples with various total organic content (TOC) at various pressures (5–20 MPa) and at 343 K. The H2 column height that can be securely trapped by the shale and capillary pressures were calculated. The shale's H2 sealing capacity decreased with increasing pressure, increasing depth and TOC values. The CO2/brine equilibrium contact angles were generally higher than H2/brine equilibrium, suggesting that CO2 could be used as favorable cushion gas to maintain formation pressure during UHS. The utmost height of H2 that can be safely trapped by shale 3 (with TOC of 23.4 wt%) reduced from 8950 to 8750 M while that of shale 5 (with TOC of 0.081 wt%) reduced slightly from 9100 M to 9050 M as the pressure was increased from 5 to 20 MPa. The capillary entry pressure decreased with increasing depth and shale TOC, implying that the capillary trapping effect, as well as the over-pressure required to move brines from the pores by hydrogen displacement, reduces with increasing depth, and shale TOC. However, the shales remained at strongly water-wet conditions, having an equilibrium contact angles of not more than 17° at highest pressure and TOC. The study suggests that the increasing contact angles with increasing pressure and shale TOC, as well as decreasing column height and capillary pressure with increasing depth for H2-brine-shale systems might not be sufficient to exert significant influence on structural trapping capacities of shale caprocks due to low densities of hydrogen.\n",

      "Impurities can easily contaminate pure hydrogen at various points in the supply chain. The maximum allowed impurity concentrations in hydrogen, sold for automotive PEMFC use, are regulated by the ISO 14687 standard. Imposing too strict limits on hydrogen quality increases the cost of hydrogen unnecessarily but too lax limits risk the performance and durability of PEFMCs. It is therefore imperative that the specified limits are based on rigorous and realistic studies of impurity behaviour in fuel cells. As part of the European Union funded projects HYDRAITE and MetroHyVe2, NPL is investigating the impact of fuel impurities on the performance and durability of fuel cells. The overall aim is to develop new testing standards and provide more reliable information to ISO committees for the continuous revision of fuel quality standards.  Impurity studies are being carried out primarily on commercial short stacks tested with a hydrogen recirculation loop and a dead-end anode. This operation mode is typical in real systems as it gives a very high fuel utilisation, however it also causes fuel impurities to concentrate well above their inlet level. Standard fuel cell testing is coupled with online measurements of the concentration of a range of contaminants inside the anode recirculation loop. For example, a Gas Chromatograph with a methanizer and flame ionising detector (GC-methanizer-FID) is used to provide information on CO 2 , CO, and CH 4 ; while Selected Ion Flow Tube - Mass Spectrometry (SIFT-MS) is used to analyse isotopically labelled impurities and probe the concentrations of other species as a function of time.   Our results will first show the power and limitations of using online gas analysis with isotopically labelled impurities to monitor processes related to CO poisoning in single cells. We will then demonstrate that certain hydrocarbon impurities have little impact on stack performance despite being stringently regulated. Finally, we will present information on rates of O 2 and CO 2 crossover, drawing conclusions relevant for setting the next iteration of hydrogen fuel standards. This work provides vital underpinning metrological support for the development of more robust business cases for large scale deployment of hydrogen in automotive applications.\n",

      "The reaction mechanisms of tetralin as a model compound of heavy petroleum fractions were investigated with the aim of improving bifunctional USY zeolite-based catalysts for heavy-oil hydrocracking. The major reaction path in the initial period was found to differ from that later in the reaction. In the initial reaction period, over USY catalysts with and without NiW sulfide, the reaction began with the formation of phenylbutyltetralin from two tetralin molecules by electrophilic aromatic substitution. Phenylbutyltetralin subsequently decomposed into benzene and octahydro tricyclic aromatic compounds. These reactions were catalyzed without the involvement of gaseous hydrogen and very likely lead to coke formation by chain reactions. Later in the reaction, tetralin and the above-mentioned heavy compounds were gradually hydrocracked over the bifunctional USY-supported NiW catalyst. These results indicated that the hydrogen supply from NiW sulfide to the acid site was not fast enough to prevent retrogressive reactions of partially hydrogenated polycyclic aromatic compounds. It was inferred that a closer relationship between the active sites of hydrogenation and cracking was needed for the improvement of bifunctional catalysts in heavy-oil upgrading.\n",

However, bio-crude from HTL shows undesired high-oxygen content and needs further deoxygenation upgrading. Herein, stearic acids as a model carboxylic compounds in HTL bio-crude was employed to investigate catalytic deoxygenation performance. Results showed that (CuO) 10 -CeO2/ γ -Al2O3 had the most superior catalytic deoxygenation performance for the stearic acids. The maximum stearic acid conversion rate (96.36%) and total hydrocarbon yield (88.79%) were obtained at 300 °C , 12 h , ratio of stearic acid to water 1 : 4 . The main catalytic deoxygenation pathways were proposed: carbon monoxide generation (decarbonylation) – in-situ hydrogen generation (water–gas shift) – short-chain fatty acid generation (hydrogenolysis) – n-alkanes generation (decarboxylation, hydrodeoxygenation and hydrogenation). DFT calculation elucidated that CuO-CeO2 reduced the activation energy from 24.8 kcal mol −1 (vacuum) to 15.0 kcal mol −1 (catalytic). Thus, deoxygenation via CuO-CeO2/ γ -Al2O3 would be an effective method for upgrading HTL bio-crude.\n",

      " \n",
      "As global energy demand rises, natural gas now plays an important strategic role in energy supply. It is more difficult to transport and store gas than oil and consequently it lagged behind that commodity for a considerable period. Over the last couple of decades this has changed and gas markets continue to expand more rapidly than those of other fossil fuels.Natural gas is the cleanest and most hydrogen-rich of all the hydrocarbon energy sources and it has high energy conversion efficiencies for power generation. Of more significance is that gas resources discovered but as yet unexploited remain plentiful. The sector is poised for considerable growth over the next two decades and some believe that it may even overtake oil as the prime fuel between 2020 and 2030.The trend towards natural gas becoming the premium fuel of the world economy is not now easily reversible. The key and the challenge for the energy industry is how that transition is to be managed. We examine in this paper sources of natural gas, their limitations and potential. We also identify the technological and commercial challenges to be overcome in taking the world through the transition. There is a fundamental turn towards natural gas which today accounts for about 23% of the world energy demand. Large capital investments in infrastructure to enable increased gas consumption are being made on both demand and supply sides. Several gas-producing countries have embarked upon very ambitious plans for markedly increased gas output. Many new LNG facilities are being built supply chains diversifying and becoming ever more flexible. There is a growing recognition that unconventional sources of gas, such as shale gas, coal bed methane (CBM) and deep tight gas will contribute a significant component of future gas supplies as technologies evolve.Other gas conversion technologies such as GTL and CNG are attracting more serious attention, but energy efficiency, cost and cost inflation remain barriers for these promising alternatives. Natural gas is also competing strongly with other fossil fuels from an efficiency and emissions perspective as the fuel of choice for power generation. However, gas price volatility and security of supply concerns means that some power generators still favor coal and nuclear components in their power generation portfolio. As the cost of carbon emissions have a bigger impact around the world, gas has the potential to increase its share of the power generation market significantly over the coming decade. A rapid growth opportunity exists for natural gas in its potential contribution to transportation either directly or by electrifying the sector. Real and imagined environmental concerns and restricted access for OECD nations to long-term oil reserves are expected to accelerate the emergence of hydrogen fuel cells. Currently available technologies dictate that the most commercially viable source of hydrogen in large quantities is natural gas, particularly methane through the reforming processes that yield synthesis gas (i.e. carbon monoxide and hydrogen). Current technologies, investments and consumption trends suggest that natural gas will be at the center of a worldwide transformation resulting in a greatly expanded market share of gas in the energy mix for power generation, space heating, petrochemical feedstocks and transportation fuels (e.g. natural gas vehicles are now on the agenda for both energy efficiency and lower emissions reasons).\n",

      "Currently, a significant transformation for energy systems has emerged as a result of the trend to develop an energy framework without fossil fuel reliance, the concerns about climate change and air quality, and the need to provide electricity to around of 17% of world population who lacks the service. Accordingly, the deployment of power plants located close to end-users and including multiple energy sources and carriers, along with the growing share of renewable energies, have suggested changes in the energy sector. Despite their potential capabilities, the design of distributed energy systems (DES) is a complex problem due to the simultaneous goals and constraints that need to be considered, as well as to the high context dependence of this kind of projects. For these reasons, in this work a systematic literature review of DES including hydrogen as energy vector, was made analyzing 106 research papers published between the years 2000–2018, and extracted from Scopus® and Web of Science databases. The aim was to identify how hydrogen is employed (technologies, uses) and the criteria that are evaluated (economic, technical, social and environmental) when these systems are designed, planned and/or operated. The results constitute a baseline information covering the type of technologies, equipment sizes and hydrogen applications, that could be valuable for the preliminary stages of research or project planning of DES involving hydrogen. Furthermore, other factors have also been identified, such as the focus on techno-economic issues, and the lack of considering socio/political aspects and the uncertainty about input data like weather conditions, energy prices and demands. Additionally, a more integrated approach is needed including all the hydrogen supply chain stages and project stakeholders, to tackle issues like safety of the energy systems that could produce consumer rejections.\n",

Due to its organic- and nutrient-rich nature, theoretically food waste can be converted to valuable products (e.g. bio-products such as methane, hydrogen, ethanol, enzymes, organic acids, chemicals and fuels) through various fermentation processes. Such conversion of food waste is potentially more profitable than its conversion to animal feed or transportation fuel. Food waste valorisation has therefore gained interest, with value added bio-products such as methane, hydrogen, ethanol, enzymes, organic acids, chemicals, and fuels. Therefore, the aim of this review is to provide information on the food waste situation with emphasis on Asia–Pacific countries and the state of the art food waste processing technologies to produce enzymes.\n",

      "Fatty acid deoxygenation is a method for producing renewable hydrocarbon fuels such as green diesel, jet biofuel and biogasoline. In the present commercial method, deoxygenation is directly applied to vegetable oils through liquid phase hydrotreatment. This method is expensive because it consumes a large amount of hydrogen and requires severe operating conditions. The objective of this study was the production of a diesel-like hydrocarbon fuel that can be considered as drop-in replacement for petroleum-based diesel fuels, by catalytic thermal decarboxylation of Mg-Zn basic soap. In particular, this study investigated the decarboxylation of Mg-Zn basic soap at low temperature and pressure, without external supply of hydrogen. The Mg-Zn basic soap (9/1 mole ratio of Mg/Zn) was derived from palm stearin and decarboxylated at 350 °C and atmospheric pressure for 5 hours. The basic soap effectively decarboxylated, yielding a diesel-like hydrocarbon fuel with a liquid product yield of 62%-weight. The resulting hydrocarbon product is a complex mixture consisting of normal paraffins in the range of carbon chain length C 8 –C 19 , iso-paraffins and various olefin products.\n",

      " \n",
      "The in vitro / vivo properties of the anti-heart failure drug milrinone were optimized by cocrystallizing with a nutraceutical, ferulic acid.   A drug-nutrient cocrystallization-driven strategy has been established to highlight the superiority of nutraceutical ferulic acid (FEA) in perfecting the biopharmaceutical peculiarities of anti-heart failure drug milrinone (MLN). Taking the strategy as guidance, a novel cocrystal of MLN with FEA, namely MLN–FEA, is assembled and characterized, which reveals that the obtained solid form is a cocrystal of MLN molecule and FEA with the ratio of 1 : 1. There are milrinone–ferulic acid hydrogen-bonding couples, which are assembled into hydrogen-bonding chains in the crystal, and these chains connect the bilayer structure of MLN molecules gathering with π⋯π interactions of CO/CN groups with the pyridine rings to the whole three-dimensional framework. The combination of theoretical and experimental approaches proves that the aggregation motifs and structural features constituted by the introduction of ferulic acid in the crystal lattice have a significant effect on improving the solubility and permeability of the cocrystal. Interestingly, compared with the parent drug MLN, the ameliorated properties in vitro can be effectively transformed into a pharmacokinetic trait in vivo , revealing the extended half-life and raised bioavailability. Thereby, the current research not only supplies a novel solid form of MLN with potential commercial value, but provides some new opinions for the applications of nutritients in cardiotonic pharmaceutical cocrystals.\n",

One major limitation of this approach is that its complexity grows rapidly as we increase the number of objectives. This work proposes a computational framework to reduce the dimensionality of multi-objective optimization (MOO) problems that identifies and eliminates in a systematic manner redundant criteria from the mathematical model. The method proposed builds on a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulation introduced in a previous work by the authors. We illustrate the capabilities of our approach by its application to two case studies: the design of supply chains for hydrogen production and the multi-objective optimization of metabolic networks.

The composite shows mass transport selectivity, which is demonstrated by the high ratios of the initial conversion rates in the competitive hydrogenation of a linear and a dibranched alkene, reaching average values of 35 at 100 °C. At the temperatures applied, adsorption of the alkene is dominant and hydrogen supply to the catalytic sites is relatively small. As a result the double-bond migration is more pronounced than with an uncovered platinum catalyst. At the catalytic sites of the composites steric constraints are observed, which lead to regioselectivity in the hydrogenation of long-chain alkenes. A linear alkene with a terminal double bond is converted preferentially over an isomer with an internal double bond.\n",

      "A one-step soft templating strategy for synthesizing uniform and monodisperse mesoporous carbon nanospheres (UM-MCNs) with sub-100 nm size and large mesopores without using any co-solvent additives has not yet been reported. Herein, an extremely simple,effective and environment friendly strategy was first developed to prepare uniform, monodisperse polymer nanospheres (PNs) and UM-MCNs with small particle size (80–90 nm) and large mesopores (~ 6.8 nm), where F108 with long hydrophilic chains not only served as mesopore-forming reagent, but also as a dispersant reagent that facilitated uniform growth of the nanospheres, resulting in a narrow particle size distribution. Moreover, F108 could also act as a stability-driving agent, that is, the phloroglucinol/formaldehyde polymer was tightly “locked” by the long hydrophilic segments of F108 via strong hydrogen bonding. Consequently, intact carbon nanospheres with large mesopores were obtained after carbonization, and finally a three-dimensional periodic arrangement of the UM-MCNs was formed. In addition, ethanol could be used as a co-surfactant or co-solvent during self-assembly. The present strategy may not only supply a novel avenue to synthesize UM-MCNs, but also shed light on insights into the profound impact of F108 with long hydrophilic chains and ethanol on the morphology and pore size of carbon spheres.\n",

      "Today's manufacturing is based on ample fossil fuel sources, large and centralized plants, and high waste intensity. Climate change, aging infrastructure, dwindling resources, increasing population, changing geopolitical landscape, and the COVID-19 pandemic have laid bare the frailties of the current global supply chain. While there is still place for centralized production, geographic variation in renewable energy sources and sustainable feedstocks calls for a flexible approach towards smaller-scale and more decentralized production. With the pressing need for decarbonization of power generation and the chemical value chain, flexible manufacturing will play a major role in redefining the energy-chemistry nexus. Intensification and modularization are identified as the key enablers for such a transition. A sample case study based on valorization of hydrogen sulfide extracted from sour gas is presented to demonstrate the potential economic favorability of modular chemical process intensification. Our work shows that a net profit of US$97 million can be achieved over a five-year operational period when compared to a conventional process.

      "Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) is an electron carrier in the respiration chain with antioxidant activity. The effects of aeration and agitation rates, dissolved oxygen levels, an electron flux inhibitor (azide), a proton gradient releaser (2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP)), and an oxidative stressor (hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)) on the intracellular CoQ10 contents in Agrobacterium tumefaciens ATCC4452 were investigated. With a decrease of dissolved oxygen level from 20 to 5%, the intracellular CoQ10 content increased about four-fold, yielding 2mg/g dry cell weight at 5% dissolved oxygen level. Azide significantly increased the intracellular CoQ10 content, with the highest value of 5.3mg/g dry cell weight in the presence of 0.45mM of sodium azide. However, DNP (up to 200μM) and H2O2 (up to 10μM) did not affect the intracellular CoQ10 content, indicating proton gradient release, and oxidative stress do not affect the synthesis of CoQ10. These results show that restricted electron flux by limited oxygen supply and the addition of azide increases the intracellular CoQ10 content, suggesting a feedback regulation of CoQ10 biosynthesis by its physiological function of electron carrier in the respiration chain.\n",

      "The intermittent nature of renewable resources requires for most applications the development of efficient and cost-effective technologies for steady supply of electrical energy. The storage of energy in the form of hydrogen chemically bound within organic molecules (rather than physically as compressed gas or cooled liquid) represents an alternative approach that is attracting great research interest. Compared to other liquid organic hydrogen carriers (LOHCs), dimethyl ether (DME) appears to have the largest potential impact on society, especially if inserted in technological chains of CO2 sequestration and utilization, so to determine an effective mitigation of environmental issues, without any net effect on the carbon footprint. Specifically, the steps of H2 storage and H2 release can take place in two coupled chemical processes, constituted by the exothermic synthesis of DME via CO2 hydrogenation and the endothermic steam reforming of DME, respectively. Herein, the latest advances in the development of heterogeneous bifunctional and hybrid catalysts for the direct hydrogenation of CO2 to DME are thoroughly reviewed, with special emphasis on thermodynamics, catalyst design and process feasibility. Despite many aspects behind the mechanism of DME synthesis from H2-CO2 streams are still to be uncovered, the recent progress in the research on H2 release by DME steam reforming is increasing the interest for effectively closing this binary H2 loop, in view of future green deals and sustainable research developments.\n",

      "21 st century energy production, conversion, and delivery systems need to go through a transition to be less carbon-intensive while meeting an increasing energy demand. In a more and more interconnected world, energy systems of various sectors (e.g. power, fuels, chemicals, etc.) go through this transition via shifting the primary energy sources from carbon-intensive fossil-fuels to renewable and sustainable resources. With this study, we present a multi-scale strategy for optimal design and operation of multi-product process systems that can produce power, synthetic fuels, chemicals, and energy carriers from renewable and fossil resources. This multi-scale approach combines process synthesis, scheduling, and supply chain concepts in a mixed-integer linear programming model to address the trade-offs between integrating various fossil and renewable technologies. Our strategy is applied to integration of low-emission (i) synthetic liquid transportation fuels, (ii) hydrogen, (iii) ammonia, (iv) methanol, and (v) renewable power production from natural gas, solar, and wind energy at a location in Amarillo, Texas. Case study results show that with our approach various energy systems can be modeled either separately and integrated with the same common representation. Sectors integration to produce low-emission products in the same facility can result in 17% reduction in total production costs. While solar and wind energy are favorable to produce renewable power, current state-of-the-art methane conversion technologies are more favorable to produce hydrogen and hydrogen-based products.\n",

However, integrated PEC systems based on metal oxides still lack the high efficiencies required for a large-scale, economically feasible applications. A main obstacle for the realization of higher solar-to-hydrogen efficiencies is the appropriate design of the semiconductor–catalyst and semiconductor–electrolyte interfaces. Thus, a more accurate understanding of the energy loss mechanisms and the driving forces that determine the charge separation, transport and recombination of electrons and holes in a PEC device would would be instrumental for the selection of the most appropriate design routes. In this context we highlight a common misconception within the PEC research community, which is to consider the built-in electrical field at the solid/liquid interface as essential for charge separation. We subsequently emphasize the established viewpoint within the photovoltaic research community that the gradient of the electrochemical potential is the principal driving force for charge separation and efficient solar energy conversion. Based on this realization, we argue that improved contact design in PEC devices should be one of the main research directions in the design of PEC devices. To address this challenge, we take a closer look at how optimized contacts have been constructed so far and present potential design approaches which can be used to further improve the performance of PEC devices.\n",

      "The potential environmental impacts of producing and using future electric vehicles (EVs) are important given their expected role in mitigating global climate change and local air pollutants. Recently, studies have begun assessing the effect of potential future changes in EVs supply chains on overall environmental performance. This study contributes by integrating expected changes in future energy, iron, and steel production in the life cycle assessment (LCA) of EVs. In this light, the study examines the impacts of changes in these parameters on producing and charging future EVs. Future battery electric vehicles (BEV) could have a 36–53% lower global warming potential (GWP) compared to current BEV. The change in source of electricity generation accounts for 89% of GWP reductions over the BEV’s life cycle. Thus, it presents the highest GWP reduction potential of 35–48%. The use of hydrogen for direct reduction of iron in steelmaking (HDR-I) is expected to reduce vehicle production GWP by 17% compared to current technology. By accounting for 9% of the life cycle GWP reductions, HDR-I has the second-highest reduction potential (1.3–4.8%). The results also show that the potential for energy efficiency improvement measures for GWP reduction in vehicle and battery manufacture would be more beneficial when applied now than in the distant future (2050), when the CO2 intensity of the EU electricity is expected to be lower. Interestingly, under the same conditions, the high share of renewable energy in vehicle supply chains contributed to a decrease in all air pollution-related impact categories, but an increase in toxicity-related categories, as well as land use and water consumption.\n",

      "Several ethylee bidged polymes cntaining benzene, naphthalene, anthracene, and hydroaromatic rings have been synthesized. Pyrolysis data for these polymers have led to an improved understanding of coal pyrolysis and have been used to validate and extend the tar formation model recently proposed by Solomon and King1. It has been found that the molecular weight ranges of tars are controlled to first approximation by the temperature where tar is evolved and that tar evolution temperatures are determined by the stability of the bridging bonds between the aromatic rings in a polymer chain. For ethylene bridged polymers, tar formation appears to be rate-limited by homolytic cleavage of the central carbon-carbon bond in the bridges. Ethylene bridges adjacent to large aromatic rings tend to decompose at lower temperatures during pyrolysis of both coals and polymers. The rate constants for cleavage of these bonds are in good agreement with those calculated using thermochemical kinetics. Char and tar yields from these polymers seem to be determined by the availability of donatable hydrogens to ‘cap’ the free radicals formed during bond homolysis. Polymers which break a lot of bonds during tar formation and also have limited supplies of donatable hydrogens tend to produce more char than polymers with abundant donatable hydrogens. An improved tar formation model has been developed using Monte Carlo solution techniques. This model predicts char and tar yields and molecular weight distributions directly from polymer structures and the chemical rate laws for cleavage of the bridging bonds and no longer uses an adjustable parameter to simulate the consumption of donatable hydrogens. Preliminary results with this model indicate that ipso substitution, radical recombination, and high temperature crosslinking reactions play important roles in the formation of tar by ethylene bridged polymers.\n",

The north-south–trending Sanriku Escarpment has a thrust origin and is subparallel to the trench axis along which the Pacific plate is being subducted beneath the North America or Okhotsk plate at about 300° at a rate of about 7.8 to 8.3 cm/yr. The trends of colonies are concentrated at 250°, 300°, and 330°: each trend matches either an antithetic riedel shear, extension fracture, or synthetic riedel shear, respectively, within a left-lateral shear regime caused by the oblique subduction. Methane- and hydrogen sulfide–bearing fluid advection from depth occurs essentially along the thrust fault, but finally seeps along the fractures at the sea floor. This supplies energy to the food chain through bacteria utilizing hydrogen sulfide, then eventually sustains the Calyptogena colonies.

      " \n",
      "The current energy system is subject to a fundamental transformation: A system that is oriented towards a constant energy supply by means of fossil fuels is now expected to integrate increasing amounts of renewable energy to achieve overall a more sustainable energy supply. The challenges arising from this paradigm shift are currently most obvious in the area of electric power supply. However, it affects all areas of the energy system, albeit with different results. Within the energy system, various independent grids fulfill the function of transporting and spatially distributing energy or energy carriers, and the demand-oriented supply ensures that energy demands are met at all times. However, renewable energy sources generally supply their energy independently from any specific energy demand. Their contribution to the overall energy system is expected to increase significantly. Energy storage technologies are one option for temporal matching of energy supply and demand. Energy storage systems have the ability to take up a certain amount of energy, store it in a storage medium for a suitable period of time, and release it in a controlled manner after a certain time delay. Energy storage systems can also be constructed as process chains by combining unit operations, each of which cover different aspects of these functions. Large-scale mechanical storage of electric power is currently almost exclusively achieved by pumped-storage hydroelectric power stations. These systems may be supplemented in the future by compressed-air energy storage and possibly air separation plants. In the area of electrochemical storage, various technologies are currently in various stages of research, development, and demonstration of their suitability for large-scale electrical energy storage. Thermal energy storage technologies are based on the storage of sensible heat, exploitation of phase transitions, adsorption/desorption processes, and chemical reactions. The latter offer the possibility of permanent and loss-free storage of heat. The storage of energy in chemical bonds involves compounds that can act as energy carriers or as chemical feedstocks. Thus, they are in direct economic competition with established (fossil fuel) supply routes. The key technology here – now and for the foreseeable future – is the electrolysis of water to produce hydrogen and oxygen. Hydrogen can be transformed by various processes into other energy carriers, which can be exploited in different sectors of the energy system and/or as raw materials for energy-intensive industrial processes. Some functions of energy storage systems can be taken over by industrial processes. Within the overall energy system, chemical energy storage technologies open up opportunities to link and interweave the various energy streams and sectors. Chemical energy storage not only offers means for greater integration of renewable energy outside the electric power sector, it also creates new opportunities for increased flexibility, novel synergies, and additional optimization. Several examples of specific energy utilization are discussed and evaluated with respect to energy storage applications. The article describes various technologies for energy storage and their potential applications in the context of Germany's Energiewende, i.e. the transition towards a more sustainable energy system. Therefore, the existing legal framework defines some of the discussions and findings within the article, specifically the compensation for renewable electricity providers defined by the German Renewable Energy Sources Act, which is under constant reformation. While the article is written from a German perspective, the authors hope this article will be of general interest for anyone working in the areas of energy systems or energy technology.\n",

These relationships were used to construct model isoscapes for oxygen, hydrogen, carbon and sulfur for US oak with the aim of using them to forecast isotopic patterns in areas that were not sampled and predict values in samples not used to construct the models. The leading predictors for isoscape generation were oxygen isotope ratios in January precipitation for oak oxygen isotope ratios, hydrogen isotope ratios in July precipitation for oak hydrogen isotope ratios, water vapour in April for carbon isotope ratios, and reflected shortwave radiation in March in combination with sulfate concentration in May for oak sulfur isotopes. The generated isoscapes can be used to show regions an unknown sample may have originated from with a resolution dependent on the rarity of the stable isotope signature within the United States. The models were assessed using the data of 18 samples of georeferenced oak. The assessment found that 100% of oxygen, 94% of hydrogen, 78% of carbon, and 94% of sulfur isotope ratios in the 18 test dataset samples fell within two standard deviations of the isoscape models. Using the results of the isoscapes in combination found that there were 4/18 test samples which did not fall within two standard deviations of the four models, this is largely attributed to the lower predictive power of the carbon isoscape model in conjunction with high local variability in carbon isotope ratios in both the test and training data. The method by which this geographic origin method has been developed will be useful to combat illegal logging and to validate legal supply chains for the purpose of good practice due diligence.\n",

      " \n",
      "Catalytic partial oxidation (CPOX) can efficiently be used for the autothermal conversion of logistic fuels to hydrogen and synthesis gas in compact reactors to supply fuel for portable and stationary fuel cells. CPOX of characteristic constituents of logistic transportation fuels are studied experimentally in Rh/Al2O3 coated honeycomb monoliths at short contact times. Towards a fundamental understanding, the effect of the chemical structure of various hydrocarbon fuels on conversion and yield as well as the formation of coke precursors is investigated. Benzene, cyclohexane, 1-hexene and i-hexane are used to represent archetypically different classes of hydrocarbons in transportation fuels. The influence of the chain length of fuel components was evaluated by comparison of a series of linear alkanes ranging from n-hexane to n-dodecane. The effect of side chains of cyclic hydrocarbons has been studied by methyl substitution of benzene and cyclohexane. The role of the basic structure of the employed hydrocarbons is shown to dominate both production of synthesis gas and the formation of cracking products such as olefins and other coke precursors. Based on the knowledge of the behavior of the different chemical constituents of logistic hydrocarbons reference fuels can be derived.\n",

      "10.1016/j.energy.2020.117180\n",
      " \n",
      "Renewable energy based multi-energy supply microgrids not only can cover different types of demands (such as, electricity/heat/gas), but also can interconnect with different utility grid networks (electricity/heat/gas). When there are large numbers of grid-connected microgrids, how to operate these multiple microgrids in real-time is a problem. In this paper, day-ahead stochastic optimization scheduling and real-time sliding window model predictive control are used to control the operation of microgrids. In order to consider the influence of future prediction on the current optimal decision results, different prediction methods are adopted to predict the load demands and renewable energy output. For example, online learning Markov chain prediction, and support vector machine are used to predict the future values. As for comparison, robust prediction and bilevel optimization are adopted to describe the future prediction uncertainty. The real-time operation of microgrids aims to follow the day-ahead exchanged energy with utility grids, which can minimize the impact of the microgrid on the utility grids. The supply network is an IEEE30 + gas20+heat14 network. The results show that: 1) when the sliding window number is smaller, the total operation cost is larger, but the calculation time is smaller, the trade-off between sliding window numbers and calculation time should be considered; 2) the accuracy of the prediction impacts the 2-norm error of the operation cost, when we decrease by “1” unit of 2-norm prediction error of the whole system, the 2-norm operation cost will decrease by “0.15” unit; 3) from the view of the post-event analysis (total operation cost), for the Markov chain prediction method, the relative error is about 0.32%, is better than the support vector machine method; 4) in the robust cases, the larger the conservative value, the higher the stored hydrogen energy. At last, the results of real-time sliding window model predictive control problem are influenced by the future prediction methods and the window numbers.\n",

      "Green process engineering, which is founded on the concepts of the process intensification approach, can make a significant contribution to industrial sustainability. Green process engineering refers to new equipment and procedures that are intended to result in significant improvements in chemical and other manufacturing and processing elements. It entails lowering production costs, equipment size, energy consumption, waste creation, as well as boosting remote control, information flow, and process flexibility. Membrane-based technology aids in the pursuit of these ideals, and the potential of membrane operations has recently been extensively acknowledged. The efficacy of fuel cells is dependent on the correct design of the electrodes and membrane, which allows for simple access to oxygen and protons. The use of non-precious catalytic electrodes based on recyclable carbon nanostructures is critical for producing clean energy and increasing the commercialization potential of fuel cells. Green hydrogen will play a significant part in future fuel supply chains, covering 15% to 20% of the world’s energy demands. A proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell is one method, where hydrogen may be utilized to generate electricity. This paper begins by providing an overview of membrane electrolytes in fuel cells and the generation of energy. Moreover, the proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) is regarded as one of the most promising power generators capable of providing clean energy sources, particularly for transportation and stationary cogeneration applications. Finally, it will shed light on the role of green or renewable hydrogen in future fuel cells and achievement sustainability.\n",

      "The effective promotion of hydrogen technologies is best achieved when there is a strategy and a well defined and accepted plan for a hydrogen-based economy. The HYRREG project, funded by the Program of Cooperation of Southwest Europe (SUDOE), had as main objectives the development of a platform to generate hydrogen-related projects and a roadmap to enhance regional competitiveness and development of industry in this field in the SUDOE region which accounts for approximately 18% of the area and 12% of the population of the European Union. An analysis of the energy profiles in these regions reveals significant growth in capacity of renewable sources, principally from wind energy, yet the region has a high dependence on fossil fuels. The HYRREG consortium therefore believes that there is a good basis for supporting the development and introduction of hydrogen-based technologies in the region, especially with respect to the use of hydrogen for storage, to enhance security of supply and pave the way for a cleaner environment.The measures undertaken, in the form of platform activities and the preparation of a roadmap, were designed to increase collaboration between different institutions, at both national and international levels, and to raise awareness in society of the benefits of using such technologies. An online database of technologies and product opportunities in SUDOE and across Europe, as well as yearly catalogues listing profiles of companies or institutions working on hydrogen and fuel cells, their research lines and fields of interest and also including technology transfer profiles highlighting technologies offered and those sought in the region, were prepared to help companies in the region to access international markets and as an aid to establish links between entities.The SUDOE roadmap is mainly based on a qualitative analysis, focused on stakeholder preferences and region specific conditions, such as availability of resources as well as the characteristics of the current and future energy systems in the region. Several enquiries were conducted to systematically examine each component of the different hydrogen chains selected by the regions of France, Portugal and Spain. This exercise contributed to the identification of first user centres in the SUDOE region. The project concluded that hydrogen will play an important role in the energy context of SUDOE, namely in the transport sector, and its production will rely mainly on renewable energies – wind and solar being in the forefront.\n",

      "Proton exchange membrane (PEM) water electrolyzers are a key technology in decarbonizing hydrogen production. Though the market for PEM electrolyzer systems is growing, there are concerns that the cost and availability of precious metal catalysts utilized in today’s commercial systems can limit deployment. Herein, we show that while the availability of Ir should not impede deployment in the near term, the inelasticity of the Ir commodity price is cause for immediate concern. We emphasize that diversifying catalyst materials, even with other precious metals, can reduce system costs and mitigate supply chain risk. Furthermore, we analyze the trade-offs between catalyst capital cost and catalyst activity for a range of operating conditions (i.e., capacity factor, electricity price). The framework presented herein is a first step toward establishing performance targets (i.e., activity, stability, material cost) for reduced precious metal and non-precious metal catalysts as a function of PEM electrolyzer operating conditions.\n",

      " \n",
      "Conversion of a hemicellulose‐rich pre‐pulping extract into long‐chain alcohols could alleviate problems facing the liquid fuel supply and could boost the revenues of pulp mills. Kraft pulping requires only the cellulose fraction of wood, leaving much of the hemicellulose available for extraction and subsequent conversion into gasoline‐blendable alcohols. Three possible pathways for upgrading the hemicelluloses are: CKA: carboxylates → ketones → alcohols; CEA: carboxylates → esters → alcohols, and CHEA: carboxylates → acids → esters → alcohols. The scenarios were modeled using AspenPlus® to determine material and energy balances. Economic parameters were determined using the Aspen Process Economic Analyzer. The minimum ethanol selling price (MESP) for a 1000 tpd facility, which takes into account the operating and capital costs, was found to be: $3.31 for CKA, $4.56 for CEA, and $4.26 for the CHEA. The cost of hydrogen necessary for hydrogenolysis proved to be a notable expense. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd\n",

QRA software packages produce a risk matrix of potential consequences versus event probabilities without indicating uncertainty, and results are therefore shrouded in ambiguity. Due to the ‘black-box’ effect of a package, the calculations also lack transparency. Bayesian Belief Network (BBN) software modeling cause-consequence chains allow easy inspection of intermediate results and sensitivity tracking, and it can take account of data distributions instead of point values. For support of decision making, risk analysts should in addition determine the utilities of decision alternatives. Utilities describe desirability of benefits on a single scale. Rationally weighing risks versus benefits results in more transparent and defendable decisions. Example risk analyses of two types of refueling stations and three hydrogen supply transportation types applying BBNs are worked out.\n",

The group of these organic bonds includes several thousand compounds in which fluorine is linked to the (straight or branched) chain of aliphatic hydrocarbons instead of hydrogen. The article describes the permissible concentrations of PFAS in waters, the properties of these compounds, their potential impact on organisms, concentrations identified in waters, and indicates the need to limit the emissions of these compounds to surface waters. This is an important problem from the point of view of these compounds’ impact on organisms and the fact that such waters are often a source of water supply for the national economy, including consumption by the population.\n",

      " \n",
      "Introducing natural gas/hydrogen mixtures to an installed population of domestic natural gas appliances necessarily implies considering the risk of flashback. Previously, we quantified this risk via an interchangeability analysis using calculated laminar burning velocities. With an increasing contribution of renewable energy, still higher hydrogen fractions will become of interest to improve the economic viability in power-to-gas chains. To extend the possibilities for hydrogen admixture beyond the limits given by extant ranges of Wobbe Index and burning velocity, appliance approval standards and gas regulations must be examined to assess the degree to which higher hydrogen fractions are, or can be, justified. However, the current standards and regulations do not consider the risk of flashback in terms of the laminar burning velocity explicitly, leaving the justification of higher hydrogen fractions to empirical observations followed when the approval standards were codified. Here, we reframe the approval and regulation standards in terms of the calculated laminar burning velocity, which quantifies the notion of a ‘safety margin’ to safeguard appliance performance with respect to flashback, for a group of natural gases that is commonplace in the European Union (EU) but representative for many international situations. The method presented can be applied for any local regulatory area. In plots of burning velocity vs. equivalence ratio, ranges of regulated gas qualities are represented as a curve for natural gases, while for natural gas/hydrogen mixtures they appear as areas indicating the variations in hydrogen fraction for different gas compositions that do not increase the risk of flashback. To quantify the safety margin, the approval gas used in the EU for flashback (G222) is taken as an example, because of the many decades of experience in using this gas to safeguard appliance performance. Using the assumed range of gas quality and approval gas as an example, for appliances whose primary equivalence ratio is fuel rich (at greatest risk for flashback), a safety margin of 11.5 cm/s is determined and used in analyses for determining the composition of flashback limit gases in approval standards for a situation in which higher hydrogen fractions are desired. Situations considering both variable and constant fractions of hydrogen in natural gas are examined. The end-use demand for a minimum degree of thermal comfort, by having a minimum Wobbe Index in the regulated range of gas quality, automatically complicates grid management schemes for hydrogen addition: the maximum hydrogen admixture is necessarily coupled to the composition of the natural gas to which it is added. The only solution for having a constant hydrogen fraction without regard to the gas composition is by relaxing this demand on thermal comfort; in the example used here, 20% hydrogen admixture reduces the thermal comfort in the worst case by 4.7%. Fuel suppliers, grid operators and end users must agree to this loss of fitness for purpose to maximize the decarbonization of the gas supply by hydrogen admixture.\n",

      "In the Tyumen region, groundwater is widely used for household and drinking water supply, the chemical composition of which is influenced by the increased marshland and peat resistance of soils and, in some cases, the presence of oil and gas-bearing horizons. Underground water typically has a high content of dissolved organic impurities (permanganate oxidability 11.7 -  23.0 mg/dm                     3                     ), elevated concentrations of free carbon dioxide (20.0 200.0 mg/dm                     3                     ), hydrogen sulfide (0.20 - 1.95 mg/dm                     3                     ) and methane (5.3 - 60.0 mg/dm                     3                     ), dissolved forms of iron (1.14 - 14.00 mg/dm                     3                     ), manganese (0.02 - 3.80 mg/dm                     3                     ).                                      Analysis of iron removal plants operation was performed. Analysis of the region's iron removal plants showed that the process of iron removal of water depends on the degree of saturation of water with air oxygen with parallel removal of dissolved gases. Pre-degassing of water with high efficiency degassers is a necessary link of the process chain even when reagent purification techniques are used.                   Analysis and systematization of existing degassers to remove dissolved carbon dioxide have shown that despite the high-efficiency of some degasser models, they are complex in design and require considerable capital construction and operation costs. There is a need to develop a design not complicated in design, having high degassing efficiency at low economic costs.\n",

      "Within this paper, new findings of the potential of four considered intermediate solutions towards a primary climate-neutral steel production are reported. (1) Injection of natural gas into a blast furnace, (2) injection of hydrogen into a blast furnace, (3) natural gas-based direct reduction with subsequent input of the hot briquetted iron (HBI) in a blast furnace, and (4) hydrogen-based direct reduction with subsequent input of the hot briquetted iron in a blast furnace. The current study is a carbon footprint assessment applied to the product hot-rolled coil (HRC) according to the ISO norm 14067:2019. A cradle to gate approach is used including the production of raw materials to the production of hot-rolled coil. To define a reference point, a carbon footprint of hot-rolled coil produced via a typical blast furnace – basic oxygen furnace (BF-BOF) route is presented. The basic data set is based on primary data from the integrated site of thyssenkrupp Steel Europe AG (tkSE), year 2018. Within a novel approach, this base line is enhanced by integrating metallurgical models from the literature. Thereby all changes of the complex material and energy supply chain of an integrated site and of the upstream chain are reported. The carbon footprint of each process unit is presented in detail so that optimization potentials are identified, which impacts are analysed within a sensitivity analysis. A holistic comparison of using hydrogen in a blast furnace to using hydrogen in a direct reduction plant is presented and delivers important findings. This can help steel producers to maximize the efficiency of hydrogen use. Since the focus of this paper lies on the comparison of steel production routes and the assessments for all considered scenarios are based on the same methodologies and databases the sensitivity of made assumptions on the deltas between these scenarios is much weakened than the sensitivity of absolute values. That's one of the reasons why, the conclusions of this paper, which are referred to the plant of tkSE, can be transferred to other production sites, as well. The presented results can help decision-makers to know the potentials of possible intermediate solutions towards a climate-neutral steel production and how the potentials can be maximized. The carbon footprint of the product hot-rolled coil is 2.1 t CO2eq/tHRC following the recycled content approach and 0.82 t CO2eq/tHRC following the end-of-life recycling approach. The reduction potential for the carbon footprint is about 4 % for injecting natural gas into a blast furnace and about 9 % for injecting hydrogen into a blast furnace. The hydrogen is produced via electrolysis driven by a renewable German energy mix, year 2018. Using hot briquetted iron (HBI) within a blast furnace leads to a reduction potential between 5 % and 12 % for natural gas based-HBI and between 10 % and 17 % for H2-based HBI. The reduction potential strongly depends on the iron feedstock, which is replaced by the hot briquetted iron. Between 4.5 and 7.0 kg CO2eq/kg H2 are avoided by injecting hydrogen into a blast furnace, and about 5.4 kg CO2eq/kg H2 are prevented if the hydrogen is injected into a direct reduction plant.\n",

      "During the ARCTIC ′91-Expedition with RV “Polarstern”, several Kastenlot-cores were recovered along a profile crossing the eastern part of the Arctic Ocean. In this paper we present results of detailed sedimentological and organic geochemical investigations on three of these cores, which have yielded a wide range of data for the interpretation of the flux and type of organic matter. In general, the high organic carbon content of the sediments is derived from a high input of terrigenous organic matter. The variation in content and composition of the organic carbon in the sediments of Core PS2174-5 reflect glacial/interglacial changes. Interglacial Stages 7 and 5e reveal a low organic carbon content (< 0.5%) and, as indicated by high hydrogen indices, low C/N ratios, higher content of n-alkanes (C17 and C19), and a high opal content, reflect higher marine productivity. During the glacial stages (Stages 6, upper 5, and 4), organic carbon values are significantly higher (0.7–1.3%). Low hydrogen indices, high C/N ratios, low short chain n-alkanes, and low opal contents provide evidence for a higher input of terrigenous organic matter and reduced marine productivity. Changes in the content and composition of the organic carbon are believed to vary with the fluctuations in sea-level and sea-ice coverage.\n",

      "Biological conversion of gaseous compounds (e.g., H2/CO2) into valuable liquid fuels or chemicals using mixed culture is a promising technology, which could be effectively and efficiently implemented in a membrane biofilm reactor (MBfR) with gas being supplied from inside of membranes. In this study, a model integrating multiple production pathways of fatty acids (including acetate, butyrate, and caproate) was developed and tested using reported mixed culture experimental data from a lab-scale MBfR fed with 60% H2 and 40% CO2. The uncertainty of the four estimated model parameters was explored by a sensitivity analysis. With the developed model, the impacts of key process parameters (i.e., gas supply and hydraulic retention time (HRT)) on the performance of the MBfR converting H2/CO2 to fatty acids were then investigated. The results show that a high HRT is imperative for chain elongation to produce a higher proportion of caproate with a higher added value. A proper gas supply should be provided to favour the speciation of biological gas conversion products as well as to fully exploit the conversion capacity of the MBfR. The findings of this work provide useful information for a better understanding and further applications of this MBfR technology for mixed culture syngas fermentation.\n",

      "The identification of site location is one of the critical tasks in developing or expanding any supply chain system including the construction of renewable power generation plants. The accurate identification of a plant site can considerably reduce unforeseen risks and costs and also raise productivity and efficacy. As such, this study sought to thoroughly evaluate all capital cities of a developing country for the establishment of a hybrid wind/solar power plant to produce hydrogen while considering the most influential and conflicting criteria. For this, 14 criteria including daily solar radiation, wind power density, clearness index, altitude, population, average sunny hours in a year, unemployment rate, average air temperature, average air humidity, average yearly precipitation, natural disasters, the distance between the site and the main road, average dusty days per year, and land price constituted the set of vital factors. To prioritize alternatives, a Fuzzy Multi-Criteria Decision Making approach named FVIKOR (Fuzzy Multi-Criteria Optimization and Compromise Solution) was used. The results indicated that among 31 capital cities, the city of Yazd with a wind power density of 309.5 W/m2 and daily solar radiation of 5.4 kWh/m2 would be the best location for the purpose of this study. To validate the findings, FTOPSIS (Fuzzy Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) method was utilized and it also ranked Yazd as the first option. Then, a sensitivity analysis was conducted to discern the behavior of each criterion and their impact on the ranking of the cities. Finally, for hydrogen generation, an autonomous hybrid wind/solar system was techno-economically assessed using HOMER software. According to the analysis outcome, the proposed system showed a payback period of 7 years with levelized cost of 4.75 $/kg for hydrogen.\n",

      "Glycerol is a by-product of biodiesel obtained from biomass, accounting for 10% of the biodiesel production. In the context of a green economy, aiming for a reduction of the emission of atmospheric greenhouse gases emissions, the demand of biodiesel is expected to increase vastly, in parallel with a side glut supply of glycerol. Given the high cost of biodiesel compared with its fossil congener, upgrading of glycerol into added-value products can represent a secondary income source and turn the production of such alternative fuels economically sustainable in the long term. The glycerol obtained as by-product of biodiesel from biomass is in a crude form and must be purified. Some industrial solutions and applications were therein geared. The survey presented in this work, based on a reviewing of the existing literature, examines three routes for the valuing glycerol into energy carriers and chemicals, namely, carbonation, acylation, and steam reforming to hydrogen. The latter is embodied of great interest and importance, insofar that hydrogen by itself is considered as straighforward clean fuel for transportation uses, due to its high calorific power and to recent advances in fuel cells. We also have focused on the chain value from biomass to energies carriers through these pathways.\n",

      "Innovative renewable routes are potentially able to sustain the transition to a decarbonized energy economy. Green synthetic fuels, including hydrogen and natural gas, are considered viable alternatives to fossil fuels. Indeed, they play a fundamental role in those sectors that are difficult to electrify (e.g., road mobility or high-heat industrial processes), are capable of mitigating problems related to flexibility and instantaneous balance of the electric grid, are suitable for large-size and long-term storage and can be transported through the gas network. This article is an overview of the overall supply chain, including production, transport, storage and end uses. Available fuel conversion technologies use renewable energy for the catalytic conversion of non-fossil feedstocks into hydrogen and syngas. We will show how relevant technologies involve thermochemical, electrochemical and photochemical processes. The syngas quality can be improved by catalytic CO and CO2 methanation reactions for the generation of synthetic natural gas. Finally, the produced gaseous fuels could follow several pathways for transport and lead to different final uses. Therefore, storage alternatives and gas interchangeability requirements for the safe injection of green fuels in the natural gas network and fuel cells are outlined. Nevertheless, the effects of gas quality on combustion emissions and safety are considered.\n",

      " \n",
      "Sector coupling via H 2 could significantly reduce the cost of energy system decarbonization by providing extra flexibility for variable renewable energy integration.   There is growing interest in using hydrogen (H 2 ) as a long-duration energy storage resource in a future electric grid dominated by variable renewable energy (VRE) generation. Modeling H 2 use exclusively for grid-scale energy storage, often referred to as “power-to-gas-to-power (P2G2P)”, overlooks the cost-sharing and CO 2 emission benefits from using the deployed H 2 assets to decarbonize other end-use sectors where direct electrification is challenging. Here, we develop a generalized framework for co-optimizing infrastructure investments across the electricity and H 2 supply chains, accounting for the spatio-temporal variations in energy demand and supply. We apply this sector-coupling framework to the U.S. Northeast under a range of technology cost and carbon price scenarios and find greater value of power-to-H 2 (P2G) vs. P2G2P routes. Specifically, P2G provides grid flexibility to support VRE integration without the round-trip efficiency penalty and additional cost incurred by P2G2P routes. This form of sector coupling leads to: (a) VRE generation increase by 13–56%, and (b) total system cost (and levelized costs of energy) reduction by 7–16% under deep decarbonization scenarios. Both effects increase as H 2 demand for other end-uses increases, more than doubling for a 97% decarbonization scenario as H 2 demand quadruples. We also find that the grid flexibility enabled by sector coupling makes deployment of carbon capture and storage (CCS) for power generation less cost-effective than its use for low-carbon H 2 production. These findings highlight the importance of using an integrated energy system framework with multiple energy vectors in planning cost-effective energy system decarbonization.\n",

      "A novel approach for sustainability enhancement of jet biofuel production from palm oil and soybean oil is proposed. A comparative Well-to-Wake analysis was performed assuming a supply chain in two strategic regions of Brazil, according to each raw material. The functional unit was 1.0 MJ of energy, and impacts were quantified using Impact 2002 + and Cumulative Energy Demand methods. Two different situations, referred to as scenarios, for each vegetable oil were proposed. First conversion scenario (baseline case) included conventional jet biofuel production characteristics, regarding the use of fossil hydrogen. Second conversion scenario (enhanced case) explored renewable alternatives for hydrogen production, such as residual biomass gasification, in palm oil case, and water electrolysis, for soybean oil scenario. Results indicate significant reductions, ranging from 57% to 94%, in the global warming impact category of all scenarios as compared with conventional jet fuel. Moreover, palm oil and soybean oil improved scenarios reached the lowest carbon footprint of 4.8 and 33.9 g CO2 eq/MJ, respectively. Additionally, when considering Life Cycle Energy Efficiency an increase of about 65% and 63% for palm oil and soybean oil enhanced scenarios was observed, compared to baseline cases. In the case of Fossil Energy Ratio, an increase of 4.4% and 29.6% was determined in the same vein. Besides, in all scenarios, palm oil showed lower consumption of fossil and renewable energy than soybean oil. Some limitations of the present work can be described as: economic and logistic feasibility, due to immature technologies; geographic conditions which could affect agricultural performance; and technical aspects regarding hydrogen production technologies.\n",

      "Assessing the Mitigation Potential of Environmental Impacts From Circular Economy Strategies on an Industrial Sector and Its Value Chain: A Case Study on the Steel Value Chain in Quebec\n",
      "10.3389/frsus.2021.738890\n",
      " \n",
      "This research project aims to evaluate the potential reduction of environmental impacts from circular economy strategies on an industrial sector at a regional scale with a case study on Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions in Quebec's steel industry and its value chain. To do so, an integrated model has been created based on the matrix approach, building on material flow analysis (MFA) tracking flows and stocks and on life cycle assessment (LCA) to compute direct (from the activity, e.g., combustion process) and indirect (from the supply chain, e.g., production of raw material inside or outside of region) emissions. This theoretical model is designed to be applied to any emissions or environmental impacts from a specific sector in a given region and enable to model the effects of circularity strategies to both flows and related environmental impacts. The overall mitigation potential of individual or combined circular economy strategies on a specific sector could thus be evaluated across its entire value chain. In the case study, a set of the most promising circular strategies applicable in the Quebec context were identified, and the GHG reduction potential within and outside the province is calculated and compared with actual emissions. Six circular strategies were analyzed acting at three different levers, namely, GHG/material (increase iron recycling rate, switch to hydrogen-based reduction production), material/product (reduce weight of vehicle, limit over-specification in building construction), and product/service (increase buildings and cars lifetime, increase car-sharing), and therefore impact rather direct or indirect emissions on different stages of the steel life cycle. Combining these six strategies into a consolidated scenario shows that a circular-driven economy allows to cut down GHG emissions of the cradle-to-gate steel industry value chain by −55%, i.e., 1.67 Mt CO2e. Taking into account use phase of steel, overall reductions are estimated at −6.03 Mt CO2e, i.e., −30% of the whole life cycle.\n",

      " \n",
      "The response of the Arctic hydrologic cycle to global warming includes changes in precipitation patterns and moisture availability associated with variable sea ice extent and modes of atmospheric circulation. Reconstructions of past hydroclimate changes help constrain the natural range of these systems, identify the manners in which they respond to different forcing mechanisms, and reveal their connections to other components of the climate system, all of which lead to a better understanding of present and future changes. Here we examine hydroclimate changes during the Holocene in the High Arctic archipelago of Svalbard by reconstructing the isotopic composition of precipitation. We measured the hydrogen isotopic composition (δD values) of leaf wax compounds (n-alkanes; C25-C31) in a sediment core from Lake Hakluytvatnet on the island of Amsterdamøya, northwest Spitsbergen. We interpret δD values of mid-chain (C25) and long-chain (C29, C31) length n-alkanes to represent changes in the isotopic composition of lake water and precipitation over the last 12.9 ka. After deglaciation of the catchment, water supply became restricted and the lake experienced significant evaporative isotopic enrichment indicating warmer conditions from 12.8 to 7.5 ka. The isotope values suggest an increase in the delivery of moisture from warmer sub-polar air masses between 12.8 and 9.5 ka, followed by generally warm, but unstable conditions between 9.5 and 7.5 ka, possibly indicating a response to meltwater forcing. Sedimentary evidence indicates a hiatus in deposition c. 7.5–5.0 ka, likely as a result of desiccation of the lake. At c. 5.0 ka lacustrine sedimentation resumed and over the last 5 ka there was a progressive increase in the influence of polar air masses and colder conditions, which culminated in an abrupt shift to colder conditions at c. 1.8 ka. This late Holocene cooling ended c. 0.18 ka, when isotopic data indicate warmer conditions and greater influence of moisture derived from lower latitudes.\n",

      "Forest residue extraction levels in Greece are currently very low, but logging residues have the potential to be an important component of the wood energy supply chain. Forests are a major supplier of renewable energy. Exploring the possibilities of utilizing the biomass of logging residues for energy requires analysis and knowledge of its properties. In this research work the properties (ash, volatiles, fixed carbon, carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen and calorific value) of the various constituents of the biomass of fir (Abies borisii - regis), pine (Pinus nigra), oak (Quercus frainetto) and beech (Fagus silvatica) logging residues were determined. Bark and ash content increased with decreasing diameter of branches. Ash content was higher in bark than in wood of branches in all species. Ash and nitrogen content was several times higher in bark and in foliage or needles than in wood of branches. Oak branches and twigs of all species had ash and nitrogen content higher than that required by the EN ISO 17225-2 standard for domestic pellets and they should not be used for energy, at least for pellets production. Volatile mater, fixed carbon, carbon and hydrogen content were in the range given by other researchers. Heating value is higher in softwood (fir and pine) than in hardwood (oak and beech) and ranged from 18.72 MJ/kg to 21.00 MJ/kg. In addition, Duncan's multiple range test was used to compare the means between the various constituents in all species.\n",

      "The primary base of the food chain of the dense animal populations found clustered around deep-sea hydrothermal vents1,2 appears to be chemoautotrophic bacteria, whose energy source is geothermally reduced hydrogen sulphide emitted from the vents3,4. Recently, a symbiotic association has been postulated5 between chemoautotrophic sulphur-oxidizing bacteria and the vent tubeworm, Riftia pachyptila Jones (phylum Pogonophora) on the basis of histological5 and enzymatic6 evidence. Hydrothermal vents thus appear to be a spectacular example of the role of reduced inorganic elements in animal nutrition. Marine muds and salt marsh sediments also produce a continuous supply of reduced sulphur compounds7,8, so the possibility arises that they support similar symbiotic associations5,9. I now present microscopic, enzymatic, and physiological evidence for the occurrence of intracellular sulphur-oxidizing chemoautotrophic bacteria in a bivalve, Solemya velum Say (phylum Mollusca), found in reducing muds of eelgrass beds. Bacterial symbionts were also observed in other animals from a variety of sulphide-rich habitats. It thus seems that symbiotic relationships with bacteria are widespread among sulphide-habitat marine invertebrates, and may have a significant role in their nutrition.\n",

      " \n",
      "Ports form a vital link in the global maritime supply chain, and adherence to the UN sustainable goals in each port development and operation is all-important. Improving the sustainability performance of port infrastructure requires identifying all relevant aspects of sustainability, defining suitable performance measures, applying tools for quantification, and proposing intervention measures if needed. We present a framework for assessing and managing the sustainability performance of port infrastructure incorporating these elements. We apply the framework to quay walls in the Port of Rotterdam (PoR); however, the information to assess only four out of fourteen sustainability themes was available. This fact underlines the need for sustainability monitoring and reporting. We also present a case study of a quay wall in PoR. Based on the vision of PoR and literature, the sustainability theme ‘air pollutants’ was given priority, the selected performance measure being the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions. Dubocalc was chosen as a quantification tool and estimated a total emission of 1.9 kt of CO2eq for a 100-m length of quay wall over a 100-year lifecycle. The measures proposed to achieve climate neutrality in 2050 include using renewable energy for the Impressed Current Cathodic Protection and the temporary drainage systems, electrified transport and machinery, hydrogen as dredging fuel, and steel with hydrogen as a reduction-agent in the future. These could result in a total GHG reduction of 86% by the year 2050.\n",

      "Abstract This paper provides an introduction to the various processes for the liquefaction of coal, including pyrolysis, solvent extraction catalytic hydrogenation and indirect conversion. It then goes on to describe the Scotia Coal Synfuels Project, the Initial phases of which are currently underway.  Introduction The utilization of coal in Canada and the United States will increase significantly over the next several decades in an effort to reduce our dependence on foreign oil sources. This strategy combined with a delicate supply/demand balance for petroleum products has prompted considerable interest in the production of liquid fuels from coal. During the past fifty years, technological advances in coal conversion have been made in several countries around the world. The objective of this paper is to discuss briefly the methods of converting coal into liquid fuels and outline the activities of the Scotia Coal Synfuels Project, a consortium of five major Canadian companies formed to determine the feasibility of producing liquid transportation fuels from the indigenous coal resources of Cape Breton. Coal has a much lower atomic ratio of hydrogen to carbon than natural petroleum. Therefore, in order to liquefy coal it is essential to increase the hydrogen-to-carbon ratio to higher levels typical of liquid fuels. However, increasing the hydrogen content of coal to + 10% does not mean that the liquids that are produced will be similar or have the same uses as petroleum-derived liquids of the same hydrogen content. The basic reason for this is that petroleum-derived liquids are mostly straight-chain molecules which are termed aliphatic, whereas those derived from coal are mostly ring-type molecules which are called aromatic. The ring-type structure of coal liquids is directly related to the fundamental structure of coal itself. Although the structure of coal is complex, there is a rather general agreement that the skeletal structure of bituminous coal is mostly aromatic. Recent work indicates that ring clusters range from one to perhaps seven rings, the average cluster being comprised of about three rings(l). It is known that about 70% of all carbon atoms are in aromatic rings, but only about 23% of the hydrogen atoms are bound to aromatic carbon atoms(2). The aromatic and hydroaromatic carbons form the skeletal structures aliphatic carbon is found in side-chains and bridges connecting the clusters.   Process Schemes to Produce Coal Liquids Known processes for converting coal into liquid fuels can be classified into four broad categories: pyrolysis, solvent extraction, catalytic hydrogenation and indirect liquefaction. These approaches to liquefaction differ primarily in the degree of processing severity.   Pyrolysis Pyrolysis, also known as destructive distillation or carbonization, is the least severe approach. (Figure in full paper) general process scheme. Pyrolysis involves the heating of coal in the absence of air or oxygen to yield liquids, gases and char. In this method, the hydrogen-to-carbon ratio is increased because carbon is removed from the system as a solid residue.\n",

      "A dual-signal-amplified cloth-based ECL biosensor has been firstly explored to detect p53 gene, where the luminol functionalized gold nanoparticles (Lu-AuNPs) are used for probe labels and signal amplification, and the hybridization chain reaction (HCR) is further applied to increase the sensitivity of ECL detection. Carbon ink/solid wax-based screen-printing is utilized to manufacture the cloth-based carbon electrodes and sample/auxiliary chambers to construct a collapsible three-dimensional (3-D) cloth-based device. Profiting from the 3-D device feature, it is easy to prepare the sensing interface modified by multi-walled carbon nanotubes. When the target DNA, signal nanoprobes and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) are successively dropped onto the sensing interface, the Lu/H2O2-based ECL can be operated well. Under optimal conditions, the p53 gene can be desirably detected, with a linear range of 0.0001–1000 pM and detection limit of 0.02 fM. The biosensor has a wider linear range, and relatively high sensitivity, selectivity, stability and reproducibility, possibly because of the excellent constitution of signal nanoprobes and HCR products. Peculiarly, the biosensor has the capacity for p53 gene detection in the complex cellular homogenate samples, and discrimination of one-, two- and even three-base-mismatched p53 DNA sequences. So, it may supply a hopeful method in applications of gene diagnostics.\n",

      " \n",
      "The conversion of water and carbon dioxide into useful products such as synthetic natural gas using renewably supplied electrical energy can offer several advantages for stabilizing the electric grid and increasing the security of energy supply chains. In addition to providing increased grid operational flexibility for dealing with intermittent renewable electrical energy supplies, infrastructure changes such as hydrogen pipelines could conceivably be avoided in situations where natural gas pipelines and CO2 sources coincide. The natural gas distribution infrastructure is well developed in many countries, enabling the fuel to be transported long distances and easily delivered throughout cities. Using the existing pipeline to transport renewably generated synthetic natural gas (SNG) can further enhance the value of the product via offering grid services such as load leveling. While the price of natural gas is near record lows in the United States, many other countries are working to develop SNG as an alternative fuel for transportation and residential/commercial heating markets, especially in Europe and for island nations. This study presents pathway studies of low- and high-temperature electrolysis integrated with an SNG plant design and evaluates their performance for producing SNG by reacting renewably generated hydrogen with carbon dioxide. The carbon dioxide feedstock is assumed to be captured and scrubbed from either an existing coal fired power plant at the city-gate or from sequestered CO 2 , where the SNG plant is co-located. In the first pathway, water is split using either low-temperature alkaline or proton exchange membrane technology. In a second path, the co-electrolysis of steam and CO 2 is done in-situ using high temperature (600°C) solid oxide cell technology. Historically, methanation has been a common practice for eliminating carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide in various chemical processes such as ammonia production and natural gas purification; for these processes, only small amounts (1-3% molar basis) of carbon oxides need to be converted to methane. A “bulk” methanation process is unique due to the high concentration of carbon oxides and hydrogen. In addition, the carbon dioxide is the only carbon source, and the reaction characteristics of carbon dioxide are much different than carbon monoxide. In process paths involving low-temperature electrolyzers, a methanation plant is required. In this study, thermodynamic and kinetic considerations of the methanation reaction are explored to model and simulate a system of reactors for the conversion of hydrogen and carbon dioxide to SNG. Multiple reactor stages are used to increase temperature control of the reactor and drain water to promote the forward direction of the methanation reaction. Heat recuperation and recovery using organic Rankine cycle units for electricity generation utilizes the heat produced from the methanation reaction. Bulk recycle is used to increase the overall reactant conversion while allowing a satisfactorily high methane content SNG product. A hydrogen membrane separates hydrogen for recycle to increase the Wobbe index of the product SNG by increasing the methane content to nearly 93% by volume. In both pathways, the product SNG has a minimum Wobbe index of 47.5 MJ/m 3 which is acceptable for natural gas pipeline transport and end-use appliances in existing infrastructures. The overall plant efficiencies of both pathways are compared as well as the expected price of the product SNG using the H2A tool.\n",

      " \n",
      "Spent acid is produced in ever-larger quantities in the sulfuric-acid washing of naphthalene. Since 2005, its production has increased by 15%, to more than 90 m3 per month. In addition, its content of organic impurities has doubled, on account of deterioration in the naphthalene fraction and the discontinuation of pyridine removal. The naphthalene content in the organic impurities has fallen by a factor of 1.5, with increase in the content of heavy pyridine bases. The removal of pyridine in polymerizational washing increased the consumption of sulfuric acid by 0.015 t/t of naphthalene. The spent acid is collected in a tank and sent for processing in the sulfate department of byproduct-capture shop 2. Analysis of the distribution of organic impurities along the supply and processing chain shows that, in comparison with 2005, the residue in the tanks after acid discharge is reduced by a factor of 1.3; the content of organic impurities remaining in the tank is reduced by 2.5. The effectiveness of partial regeneration of the spent acid in the tank is a third as much as in 2005. In all, 1.2% of the naphthalene is lost with the acid. More than 61% of the naphthalene settles in the tanks; ~9% is in the store within byproduct-capture shop 2; 28% is in the acidic tar; and 0.6% is in ammonium sulfate. Each month, >10 t of heavy pyridine bases are discharged with the spent acid: 16% remains in the tanks; >65% is in the ammonium sulfate. Since 2005, the content of pyridine bases in the ammonium sulfate has increased sevenfold. This may be attributed to increased supply of heavy pyridine bases with the spent acid and to the discontinuation of the separation of light pyridine bases from the mother liquor in the byproduct-capture shop. To reduce the output of spent acid, hydrogen peroxide is added to the concentrated sulfuric acid. The peroxymonosulfuric acid formed improves the polymerizational washing, with decrease in sulfuric-acid consumption by 15% and increase in the removal of indole from naphthalene by 18%. The consumption of hydrogen peroxide is 0.02 kg/t of naphthalene. With increase in density of the tar in the naphthalene fraction, the content of the absorbing fraction increases. Accordingly, the quality of the naphthalene fraction may be boosted by reducing the phenol content in the phenol fraction.\n",

      " \n",
      "Driven by the desire to develop novel catalyst formulations which are applicable for localised, more sustainable routes, the area of heterogeneously catalysed ammonia synthesis has attracted much attention in the academic literature in recent times. One of the key incentives for this has been the idea that ammonia synthesis for the production of synthetic fertiliser can be achieved on, for example, a farm close to its point of application with the required hydrogen feedstream being derived from sustainable sources such as electrolysis of water accomplished using electricity produced using wind turbines or solar energy sources. Further drivers are the possible application of ammonia as a non-fossil based fuel and also as a means to indirectly store intermittent over-supply of sustainably derived electricity. In the literature, the energy intensive nature of the Haber Bosch Process, frequently quoted to be 1-2% of global energy demand, and its CO2 footprint, stated to comprise 2.5% of fossil fuel based emissions, are statistics that are frequently quoted in justification for the search for new routes to ammonia production [1,2]. However, due recognition has to be given to the highly efficient integration of the Haber Bosch Process as currently operated. In relation to this, large scale synthesis of ammonia is highly optimised and it can be credited with the sustenance of ca 40% of the global population.

      "The COVID-19 crisis and ensuing supply chain disruptions prompted many breweries and distilleries to repurpose their facilities for the production of hand sanitizer, with the vast majority following the World Health Organization formulation (80% v/v ethanol, 1.45% v/v glycerol and 0.125% v/v hydrogen peroxide). The long term shift from bottling to canning among craft brewers left canning as the sole scalable option for many facilities to package hand sanitizer. With essential services desperate for hand sanitizer to help protect their staff, patients, and clients, many breweries moved to package these products in cans despite warnings that they are not designed to hold solutions containing high ethanol concentrations or strong oxidizers. The present study explores the resistance of ubiquitous can liners, WB Modified Epoxy and BPANI Gen 2, to WHO formulated hand sanitizer. Shelf life observations and microscopic visualization show the WB Modified Epoxy liner withstands hand sanitizer with little observable disruption at room temperature, while BPANI Gen 2 liners permit package failure and liquid leakage within 30 days. Incubation at 37 °C accelerated the rate of failure sixfold in BPANI Gen 2 lined cans versus room temperature incubation, providing a basis by which to expect an approximately 72 day shelf life for WB Modified Epoxy lined cans. Because of the inherent risk to consumers presented by these data and despite lack of clear guidance from regulatory agencies, manufacturers should strive to cease packaging hand sanitizer in cans and instead find supplies of inert non-beverage containers.\n",

      " \n",
      "To manage the grid with renewable electrical sources and ensure their storage, hydrogen chains have to be considered. However, hydrogen must be pressurized before being used or stored. The first levels of compression are less energetic for liquids than for the hydrogen gas, therefore the electrolysis of steam directly under pressure has to be studied. On one hand, with the solid oxide technology, the Open Circuit Voltage (OCV) presents the drawback of increasing with pressure. On the other hand, the pressure might improve the reactive species supply to the electrochemical sites and reduce the related losses. Thus, what are the electrolysis performances under pressure? And is there an energetic gain at the system level to produce pressurized hydrogen? In this context, experimental and modelling approaches have been adopted in order to understand the basic underlying mechanisms of pressurized electrolysis operation. In this frame, SOEC performance tests were realized under pressure in the range of 1 to 10 bars on two types of single commercial cells. They were based on conventional materials and differentiated by their microstructure. Concerning the set-up, the test platform requirements were achieved by developing an innovative mechanical design associated to a specific steam management. Moreover, a previously proposed electrochemical model of solid oxide electrolysis cell was adapted to take into account the pressure effects. The model allows computing all the most important operation parameters such as local current densities, local molar fraction, overpotentials and also the cell microstructural parameters [1].  According to the complete I-V curves from 0 to -1.3 A/cm 2 at 800°C with high steam conversion, it has been observed that OCVs respect the Nernst relation under pressure while the limit current appears at higher current values. This work shows that the hydrogen production can be increased thanks to a 10 bars operation at the autothermal voltage.  Moreover, these trends have been analyzed with the model. The impact of pressure on the electrochemical performances is much more important in the range of 1 to 5 bars than above. In our experimental conditions, the diffusion improvement in the porous cathode alone can explain this behavior. Finally, the impact of each microstructural parameter on the cell performances with pressure is discussed.  The research leading to these results has received funding from the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013) Fuel Cells and Hydrogen Joint Undertaking (FCH-JU-2013-1) under grant agreement 621173.

      "Received 13.01.2021. The coronavirus pandemic has accelerated global economic, technological and social transformation, including the energy sector, and has given the impetus to energy transition from organic fuels to clean energy sources. Though oil will remain an important energy resource in the global energy balance, in the long run renewables will become the leading energy. The European Union and China are the leaders in implementation of energy transition strategies from fossil to clean energy. The transformation in the energy market has affected dramatically the relations between producers and consumers, who now actively determine the consumption trends (for example, green energy, electric vehicles, etc.). Distributed generation and blockchain in power industry enable the consumers to play an active part in the electricity production and distribution chains. Digital transformation and climate agenda are changing the structure of energy business from vertically integrated companies to knowledge-intensive networks. Investors almost unanimously vote for renewable energy. The largest oil and gas companies change their long-term strategies and transform into energy holdings with the prevailing share of renewables in the business structure. Hydrogen attracts particular attention as a promising energy source. The EU plans to develop hydrogen transport infrastructure. For its part, Russia has the ability to supply hydrogen to the European market through the existing gas pipelines. Coronacrisis accelerated the development of online services, artificial intelligence, and distant work. Education and telemedicine received a powerful impetus for further development. Еducation becomes continuous process in the digital world. New educational ecosystems in which skills and competencies are worked out on an interdisciplinary basis are formed. Digital transformation meets the expectations of the generation Z, which in the coming decades will become economically active and will dominate in social and economic agenda. Digitalization, adaptive nature-like technologies, environmentally friendly energy resources, flexible horizontal network between market participants are already a post-COVID reality.\n",

      " \n",
      "This article presents the application of life‐cycle assessment in early phases of process design in the context of technology that employs a bio‐based material. The goal is to identify hot spots in the process chains with regard to environmental impacts by performing a dominance analysis. By focusing his activities on the hot spots identified, the designer is given the opportunity to efficiently improve environmental performance. This approach is illustrated for the case of supercritical water gasification, a novel technology for the treatment of organic feedstock with high moisture content. In the reactor under supercritical conditions, organic components are converted into a high‐caloric synthesis gas, with hydrogen, methane, and carbon dioxide as the main products. The data used for the assessment are obtained from laboratory tests and the literature, completed by assumptions for missing data. The scope of assessment ranges from the extraction of raw materials to the product, that is, hydrogen (cradle to gate) with sewage sludge of a municipal wastewater treatment plant used as feedstock. The assessment identifies the main sources of environmental impacts. The predominant process step in terms of global warming potential is the supply of the gasification process with additional heat. The production of a blending agent in the dewatering step is the main source of the impact category of acidification, whereas the wastewater treatment plant is the origin of emissions that lead to eutrophication. The revealed sources are analyzed further and options for reducing the environmental impacts are discussed.\n",

      " \n",
      "This work presents an integrative approach to environmental and cost assessment of current and future motorcycle technologies for four motorcycle size categories, three powertrain types, and a variety of fuel supply chains. We consider conventional gasoline (ICEV), battery electric (BEV) and fuel cell electric (FCEV) motorcycles with production years from 1990 to 2030. Motorcycle energy consumption is modelled based on the world harmonized motorcycle test cycle and calibrated with data measured from existing motorcycles. We model the potential future performance of motorcycles by adapting the model input parameters according to historic trends and future component performance predictions. We find that smaller motorcycles have much better environmental performance than larger motorcycles, though this is mostly due to the fact that larger motorcycles have different driving patterns: urban driving is found to have much lower environmental impact per kilometer than highway driving. Current BEV are found to have similar ownership costs to ICEV. They also have reduced climate change potential by roughly 60% when they are powered by electricity from natural gas, 80% when powered by renewables, and they still offer advantages over conventional motorcycles when charged with electricity from hard coal. Next generation BEV are found to have similar environmental performance advantages, though with a definite cost advantage. FCEV climate change reduction potential is found to depend strongly on the source of the hydrogen fuel, with climate benefits being substantial with hydrogen originating from renewable energy sources. Future cost competitiveness of FCEVs is linked closely to the development of fuel cell costs.\n",

      " \n",
      "Biomass can be converted into a range of different end-products; and when combined with carbon capture and storage (CCS), these processes can provide negative CO2 emissions. Biomass conversion technologies differ in terms of costs, system efficiency and system value, e.g. services provided, market demand and product price. The aim of this study is to comparatively assess a combination of BECCS pathways to identify the applications which offer the most valuable outcome, i.e. maximum CO2 removal at minimum cost, ensuring that resources of sustainable biomass are utilised efficiently. Three bioenergy conversion pathways are evaluated in this study: (i) pulverised biomass-fired power plants which generate electricity (BECCS), (ii) biomass-fuelled combined heat and power plants (BE-CHP-CCS) which provide both heat and electricity, and (iii) biomass-derived hydrogen production with CCS (BHCCS). The design and optimisation of the BECCS supply chain network is evaluated using the Modelling and Optimisation of Negative Emissions Technology framework for the UK (MONET-UK), which integrates biogeophysical constraints and a wide range of biomass feedstocks. The results show that indigenous sources of biomass in the UK can remove up to 56  Mt CO 2 /yr from the atmosphere without the need to import biomass. Regardless of the pathway, Bio-CCS deployment could materially contribute towards meeting a national CO2 removal target and provide a substantial contribution to a national-scale energy system. Finally, it was more cost-effective to deploy all three technologies (BECCS, BE-CHP-CCS and BHCCS) in combination rather than individually.\n",

      " \n",
      "Power‐to‐gas technologies are considered to be part of the future energy system, but their viability and applicability need to be assessed. Therefore, models for the viability of farm‐scale bio‐power‐to‐methane supply chains to produce green gas were analysed in terms of levelised cost of energy, energy efficiency and saving of greenhouse gas emission. In bio‐power‐to‐methane, hydrogen from electrolysis driven by surplus renewable electricity and carbon dioxide from biogas are converted to methane by microbes in an ex situ trickle‐bed reactor. Such bio‐methanation could replace the current upgrading of biogas to green gas with membrane technology. Four scenarios were compared: a reference scenario without bio‐methanation (A), bio‐methanation (B), bio‐methanation combined with membrane upgrading (C) and the latter with use of renewable energy only (all‐green; D). The reference scenario (A) has the lowest costs for green gas production, but the bio‐methanation scenarios (B‐D) have higher energy efficiencies and environmental benefits. The higher costs of the bio‐methanation scenarios are largely due to electrolysis, whereas the environmental benefits are due to the use of renewable electricity. Only the all‐green scenario (D) meets the 2026 EU goal of 80% reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, but it would require a CO2 price of 200 € t−1 to achieve the levelised cost of energy of 65 €ct Nm−3 of the reference scenario. Inclusion of the intermittency of renewable energy in the scenarios substantially increases the costs. Further greening of the bio‐methanation supply chain and how intermittency is best taken into account need further investigation. Bio‐power‐to‐methane (bio‐P2M) technology is economically viable if sustainability goals are included. In all scenarios evaluated, the energy efficiency of green gas production is improved. Biological methane formation is attractive for storing large quantities of electrical energy. The all‐green scenario of bio‐P2M can reach the 80% target for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Intermittency has a considerable impact on the viability of bio‐P2M.\n",

      " \n",
      "A mass spectrometer has measured the concentrations of ions generated when trace amounts of alkaline earth metals (Sr or Ca) were added to the gas supply of a nonturbulent, almost flat, premixed flame of H2 + O2 + N2 at atmospheric pressure. In this case, the ions produced are largely Sr+ and SrOH+; their relative concentrations are governed by the reaction Sr++H2O⇌SrOH++H being sufficiently fast to be equilibrated everywhere in a flame. Detailed studies of [Sr+]/[SrOH+] provide a method for measuring the concentration of free hydrogen atoms. Calibration techniques allowed absolute concentrations of free hydrogen atoms to be determined along the length of five fuel-rich flames with temperatures of 1820–2400 K. It was found that Sr and Ca gave identical results; also, the addition of small amounts (<0.5 vol %) of C2H2 to the burner supplies had little effect on the concentrations of radicals. Furthermore, in a hot flame (>2200 K), the measured maximum concentration of the radical pool corresponds to chain branching being almost total and also at that stage the pool is hardly affected by any recombination of radicals. Thus, the initial reaction can be written as 3H2 + O2 → 2H2O + 2H. This is a considerable simplification of the chemical changes occurring in the reaction zone. In cooler flames (<2000 K) radical recombination is more conspicuous, and the maximum concentration of radicals is significantly lower than this maximum yield. The reactions occurring in the reaction zone have been considered, and both the maximum concentration of radicals close to the reaction zone and the local temperature were derived from an extremely simple, steady-state model. Agreement with experimental values is good in all but the coolest flame. A new pneumatic method, based on the rate at which gas is sampled from a flame into a vacuum chamber, coupled with the measured [H], yielded both the composition and temperature of a flame at any point. The derived temperatures agree well with those computed from measurements of [H] using an enthalpy balance. A simple theory gave the burning velocity as ([H]m/2){k4DH/[O2]u}1/2 in one of these rich flames of H2 + O2 + N2. Here [H]m is the maximum concentration of free H atoms, DH is their diffusivity, [O2]u is the concentration of O2 in the unburned gas mixture, and k4 is the rate constant of H+O2→OH+O the rate-determining step for radical generation, evaluated at the temperature at which [H] is a maximum. This formula gives good predictions of Su for such rich flames with final temperatures above 1800 K; its basis is that the burning velocity is mainly determined by countercurrent diffusion of free H atoms into unreacted gas, coupled with more radicals being produced in reaction Eq. (4).\n",

      "Ionogels are promising electrode materials of stretchable triboelectric nanogenerators (TENG). However, the development of ionogel materials that simultaneously meet the requirements of green start feedstock, simple fabrication, multifunction, and recyclable feature remains a challenging issue. Here, we try to address this by adopting novel melt-polymerization of hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC) in molten α-lipoic acid (LA) liquid. This strategy is extremely simple, facile, based on biomass molecules, and offers a promising methodology to completely melt processing of cellulose materials. The HPC chains successfully forms the double-network structure with LA poly(disulfides) chains by multiple hydrogen bonding interactions. As result, the integrated merits of high transparency, high strength, fine stretchability, moderate conductivity, healability, ultraviolet resistance, thermal stability, strain-sensitivity, and full recyclability are realized in the obtained ionogels. Encouraging by these features, a versatile triboelectric nanogenerator (I-TENG) (3 cm × 3 cm) is fabricated using ionogels as functional electrodes. This nanogenerator can harvest biomechanical energies and convert them into electrical outputs of 80 V, 2 µA, 27 nC, and the max power density of 67.9 mW m−2 at a fixed frequency of 3 Hz, respectively. Beside transparent characteristic, this nanogenerator is able to maintain good energy harvesting performance after stretching, high temperature storage, long-term operation, mechanical damage, and even recycling. Notably, the I-TENG can not only work as green power supply to drive small electronics, but also as self-powered sensors to distinguish human motions and English letters.\n",

Here, using the ab initio evolutionary algorithm USPEX package, we searched HF–He system, which was reported as the most possible candidate to contain HHe+. The calculation proved HHe+ cannot form at pressure <1000 ​GPa, due to a conflict between the covalent component in symmetric hydrogen bond and ionic HHe+. Although He atoms have no chemical bonding with other elements, they can supply a chemical pressure, leading to two new phases He2(HF)4 and He(HF).

CO2 was captured by non-volatile amidine derivatives with simultaneous activation to form zwitterionic amidinium carbonate, and subsequent hydrogenation was facilitated by Rh/bisphosphine. The adsorption capacity and hydrogenation efficiency can be optimized by tuning the ethoxyl side chain. Particularly, the alkanolamidine bearing an intramolecular hydrogen donor derived from 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]-undec-7-ene (DBU) gave both a high CO2 uptake (molar ratio of 0.95:1) and excellent hydrogenation yield (99%).

A multiscale energy system engineering approach is followed combining process synthesis, scheduling, and supply chain concepts to address the trade-offs between various technologies in renewable power generation and storage, as well as energy carrier production and transportation across different locations.

      "Co-electrolysis as value chain process can contribute to various sectors like the chemical industry [1] or the energy sector [2] due to its high flexibility [3]. With its product syngas (a mixture of hydrogen (H 2 ) and carbon monoxide (CO)), co-electrolysis acts as an upstream process to meet changing demands within the respective downstream supply chains [3]. Additionally, when 100% of renewable energy sources are used, green syngas can be produced thus coupling and connecting renewables into the existing value chains [4,5]. In order to fulfill industrial needs, the process of co-electrolysis has to be examined in detail. This work presents a 3D model of a simplified Solid Oxide Electrolysis Cell (SOEC) operating at high temperatures in the co-electrolysis mode. In this model, we evaluate the boundaries of co-electrolysis, the steam and CO 2 electrolysis, as well as a detailed description of the co-electrolysis process with the help of a proposed reaction scheme. The model is fully coupled including electrochemical, chemical, heat and transport phenomena occurring at single cell level. We consider the heat of the reaction(s), accompanying reactions including possible surface reactions in co-electrolysis operation mode, Maxwell-Stefan interaction and electrochemical charge transfer reactions of the Butler-Volmer type. With calculating experimental characteristics like i-V curves (see Figure) or electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) curves, the influence of every parameter considered in each reaction step can be evaluated according to its value range. The model is in first instance validated with the pure electrolysis types. With the model, we can visualize the particle distribution within the porous cell, see the development of overpotential (see Figure) and obtain experimental characteristics which allow us to identify the contributions of each mechanism to them. This is an important step towards fundamental understanding of the co-electrolysis process on a small scale which can then be transferred to the large scale applications on stack level. Effects of degradation are envisioned to be incorporated into the model as well.

      "The objective implicit in the Paris Agreement, net-zero emissions around mid-century, has transformed the debate about heavy industry decarbonisation. Prior to Paris, the iron and steel, cement and concrete, chemicals, and other materials sectors were expected to reduce absolute emissions by perhaps half by 2050, through measures like energy efficiency, biofuels and carbon capture and storage. Global net-zero emissions means that these industries face far deeper transformation and potentially costly offsetting. It is also becoming clear, however, that very low emissions in heavy industry are technically possible using a spectrum of new options, including demand management, materials efficiency, and direct and green hydrogen-based electrification of primary materials production, facilitated by the falling cost of renewable electricity. Very low emissions production chains mean changes to the location of the world's heavy industry, including splitting processes into components to allow use of large-scale low-cost renewable energy or access to geological CO2 storage, with implications for trade. Existing models used for decarbonisation analysis typically do not represent the detail necessary for a full understanding of the range of mitigation options. Better representation of industry in systems modelling, along with analysis and learning about policy options and sequencing as industry transformations unfold, will be important for reaching net-zero and net-negative emissions in cost-effective and just ways. Key options, implications for the geography of heavy industry, and implications for systems modelling and policy are outlined here.\n",

      "Bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) technology is expected to support net-zero targets by supplying low carbon energy while providing carbon dioxide removal (CDR). BECCS is estimated to deliver 20 to 70 MtCO2 annual negative emissions by 2050 in the UK, despite there are currently no BECCS operating facility. This research is modelling and demonstrating the flexibility, scalability and attainable immediate application of BECCS. The CDR potential for two out of three BECCS pathways considered by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) scenarios were quantified (i) modular-scale CHP process with post-combustion CCS utilising wheat straw and (ii) hydrogen production in a small-scale gasifier with pre-combustion CCS utilising locally sourced waste wood. Process modelling and lifecycle assessment were used, including a whole supply chain analysis. The investigated BECCS pathways could annually remove between −0.8 and −1.4 tCO2e tbiomass −1 depending on operational decisions. Using all the available wheat straw and waste wood in the UK, a joint CDR capacity for both systems could reach about 23% of the UK's CDR minimum target set for BECCS. Policy frameworks prioritising carbon efficiencies can shape those operational decisions and strongly impact on the overall energy and CDR performance of a BECCS system, but not necessarily maximising the trade-offs between biomass use, energy performance and CDR. A combination of different BECCS pathways will be necessary to reach net-zero targets. Decentralised BECCS deployment could support flexible approaches allowing to maximise positive system trade-offs, enable regional biomass utilisation and provide local energy supply to remote areas.\n",

      "Importance of sorghum as staple food worldwide is unquestionable and silicon (Si) supply has decreased the foliar symptoms of anthracnose, caused by Colletotrichum sublineolum, through potentiation of defense responses and preservation of photosynthetic apparatus. This study investigated the role of Si in cytological changes as well as in the expression of genes involved in auxin metabolism (GH3.1) and in signaling pathways mediated by salicylic acid (SA) (BTHip), jasmonic acid (JA)/ethylene (ET) (LOX), and JA (Jar, AOS 1, and ACCox) by real-time polymerase chain reaction in the leaves of plants non-supplied (-Si) or supplied (+Si) with Si and non-inoculated or inoculated with C. sublineolum. Sheath cells from +Si plants were less colonized by fungal hyphae due to intense phenolics and lignin deposition and high hydrogen peroxide production. Foliar lesions for +Si plants sprayed with an ET signaling inhibitor, ET biosynthesis inhibitor, and JA biosynthesis inhibitor were bigger compared to +Si plants sprayed with water. For +Si plants sprayed with ET and JA signaling inhibitors, foliar lesions were smaller compared to -Si plants sprayed with these same compounds. Suppression of auxin biosynthesis, transporter, and signaling by specific inhibitors resulted in smaller lesions. Expressions of GH3.1, BRHip, LOX, Jar, AOS 1, and ACCox were greater for +Si plants compared to -Si plants during the infection process of C. sublineolum. This study highlighted the potential of Si to boost sorghum resistance to anthracnose through a multistep process involving hormone-signaling pathways, especially regarding auxin metabolism and homeostasis, hydrogen peroxide generation, and plant cell wall strengthening.\n",

      " \n",
      "Pollutants as electron donors and O 2 /H 2 O 2 as electron acceptor were effectively utilized, providing a strategy for realizing low energy consumption and high-efficiency AOPs.   Excessive energy consumption and low reaction efficiency caused by electron cycle rate limitations are bottlenecks in water treatment. Here, we introduce an innovative strategy to overcome this problem via constructing a novel three-dimensional (3D) hybrid of vanadium tetrasulfide cross-linking graphene-like carbon with π electrons (VSO–C(π)), which exhibits excellent performance during refractory pollutant removal based on sustainable electron cycling between hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ), dissolved oxygen (DO), and pollutants at the solid–liquid micro-interface. VSO–C(π) is synthesized through an in situ hydrothermal synthesis procedure and characterized via a series of techniques. The cation-π structures are constructed through V–S–C(π) and V–O–C(π) bridges in VSO–C(π), triggering orientable electron transfer from C(π) to the metal V centers and forming a polarized distribution of surface electrons. In the VSO–C(π)/pollutants/DO/H 2 O 2 system, the pollutants act as electron donors to C(π), with the subsequent degradation of pollutants, while DO and H 2 O 2 act as electron acceptors and are activated by reactive oxygen species to further degrade the pollutants at the V centers. This sustainable electron cycling process is responsible for the excellent activity and superior adaptability to pH changes and different salt environments, while also greatly saving resources and reducing energy consumption.\n",

      "Natural gas (NG) is delivered to homes and businesses through a complex pipeline network that mainly consists of high-pressure main feed lines and many low-pressure local distribution lines. To date, throttling valves have been employed to reduce the NG pressure between the two types of pipeline, leading to the loss of the work potential generated by the expansion of pressurized NG in the NG supply chain. As a result, research is currently underway to replace throttling valves with turbo expander generators (TEGs) to obtain additional work power. In this study, a multi-energy hub system consisting of phosphoric acid fuel cell (PAFC) and TEG modules is proposed and analyzed using ASPEN-HYSYS® modeling and simulations. The key concept underlying the system configuration is to maximize overall system efficiency through the integration of exothermic PAFC and endothermic TEG operations. When the TEG system is combined with four 460kWe PAFC stacks, the simulation results show that roughly 1.73 MWe of power can be produced in the TEG system via the expansion of a 28,000 kg/h NG stream. However, when the PAFC stack runs under hydrogen production mode (which requires high voltage operation), an additional heating source is required to fully deliver the expansion work generated by the NG flow within the TEG system. This study clearly illustrates the beneficial features of the proposed multi-energy hub system in terms of thermal integration and overall efficiency but also reveals that the system configuration and operation need to be carefully optimized in order to advance the technology.\n",

      " \n",
      "As a solid energy carrier, biomass generally has a few disadvantages, which limits its use for coal replacement and as a feedstock for entrained flow gasification. The hydrophilic and fibrous nature, the low calorific value and low bulk energy content imply high accumulated costs in the whole supply chain and severe challenges in more advanced conversion systems. By thermally pretreating the biomass by torrefaction, these properties may be significantly improved. A continuous torrefaction rotary drum reactor was designed, constructed and evaluated to enable an accurate process control and allow a homogeneous well-defined high quality product to be produced. The combined effects of torrefaction temperature (260–310°C) and residence time (8–25min) on a large number of product properties (>25) were determined for Norway spruce. The resulting mass and energy yields were 46–97% and 62–99%, respectively. Exothermic reactions were evident both at low (260°C) and high temperatures (310°C) but with no thermal runaway observed. Increased torrefaction severity resulted in decreased milling energy consumption, angle of repose, mass and energy yield, content of volatile matter, hydrogen, cellulose and hemicellulose. Hydrophobicity, heating value, carbon and fixed carbon contents increased. For all responses, the effect of torrefaction temperature was larger than the effect of residence time. Substantial interaction effects were present for mass and energy yields, volatile matter and hydrogen content. Another correlation found was the relationship of hemicellulose degradation and the brittleness of the torrefied product. Data also suggest secondary char forming reactions during the torrefaction process, resulting in higher fixed carbon content in the torrefied material than expected. The results also suggest torrefaction temperature and residence time not to be totally interchangeable.\n",

      "Transformation of road transport sector through replacing of internal combustion vehicles with zero-emission technologies is among key challenges to achievement of climate neutrality by 2050. In a constantly developing economy, the demand for transport services increases to ensure continuity in the supply chain and passenger mobility. Deployment of electric technologies in the road transport sector involves both businesses and households, its pace depends on the technological development of zero-emission vehicles, presence of necessary infrastructure and regulations on emission standards for new vehicles entering the market. Thus, this study attempts to estimate how long combustion vehicles will be in use and what the state of the fleet will be in 2050. For obtainment of results the TR3E partial equilibrium model was used. The study simulates the future fleet structure in passenger and freight transport. The results obtained for Poland for the climate neutrality (NEU) scenario show that in 2050 the share of vehicles using fossil fuels will be ca. 30% in both road passenger and freight transport. The consequence of shifts in the structure of the fleet is the reduction of CO2 emissions ca. 80% by 2050 and increase of the transport demand for electricity and hydrogen.\n",

      "As important biological functions of many creatures, structural colors and self-healing features play crucial roles in the survival of organisms. Inspired by these features, the intelligent self-healing colloidal photonic crystals (CPCs) materials with stable structural colors are constructed here by immobilizing magnetically assembling Fe3O4@SiO2 colloidal nanoparticles into a self-repairing hydrogel matrix. The self-repairing hydrogels, prepared by using biodegradable material poly­(1-vinyl-2-pyrrolidinone-co-acrylamide) modified with O-carboxymethyl chitosan (O-CMC), exhibit an outstanding mechanical property with favorable toughness and elasticity. Interestingly, one-dimensional Fe3O4@SiO2 chain structures embedded in the framework can maintain the stability of the photonic band-gap structure and its resultant bright structural colors. Furthermore, O-CMC contained in the matrix can supply plentiful carboxyl, amino, and hydroxyl functional groups which can form abundant intermolecular hydrogen bonds, and thus give the robust self-healing capability to the CPC colored hydrogels. On the basis of such CPCs hydrogels with bright structural colors and robust self-healing properties, a 3D flower pattern has been designed to realize arbitrary 3D configurable modeling. This work might constitute a promising simple way to fabricate structural colored CPC materials with a longer functional life, and thus extend their practical applications.\n",

The scope of this study is hence that to define a cost-optimized decarbonization strategy for an energy and carbon intensive industry using an Italian refinery as a case study. The methodology involves the coupling of EnergyPLAN with a Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm (MOEA), considering the minimization of annual cost and CO2 emissions as two potentially conflicting objectives and the energy technologies’ capacities as decision variables. For the target year 2025, EnergyPLAN + MOEA has allowed to model a range of 0–100% decarbonization solutions characterized by optimal penetration mix of 22 technologies in the electrical, thermal, hydrogen feedstock and transport demand. A set of nine scenarios, with different land use availabilities and implementable technologies, each consisting of 100 optimal systems out of 10,000 simulated ones, has been evaluated. The results show, on the one hand the possibility of achieving medium-high decarbonization solutions at costs close to current ones, on the other, how the decarbonization pathways strongly depend on the available land for solar thermal, photovoltaic and wind, as well as the presence of a biomass supply chain in the region.\n",

      "Renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power are important for the future energy supply chain, but require suitable energy storage and conversion technologies due to the nature of the intermittency in electricity generation. Solid oxide cell (SOC) is such a highly efficient device which can store the renewable electricity into chemical energy of fuels under solid oxide electrolysis cell (SOEC) operation mode and to regenerate the electricity using the stored fuels under solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) operation mode. However, there are significant technological barriers for the commercial viability of SOCs, one of them is the significant performance degradation under the SOEC mode. This paper reviews critically the durability and performance degradation issues of SOCs under SOEC operation conditions and the emphasis is mainly on the physical, chemical and microstructural processes that cause the degradation and their dependence on the operation conditions and nature of the oxygen and hydrogen electrodes and electrolyte materials. The degradation due to the contaminants such as chromium, boron and silica from metallic interconnect, borosilicate glass sealants and/or raw materials is also reviewed. The development of high performance and durable SOECs technology is discussed and based on the observed evidences, the sequence of the delamination processes at the oxygen electrode/YSZ electrolyte has been proposed.\n",

Although most of the fundamental processing steps involved in biorefining are well-known, there is a need for a methodology capable of evaluating the integrated processes in order to identify the optimal set of products and the best route for producing them. The complexity of the product allocation problem for such processing facilities demands a process systems engineering approach utilizing process integration and mathematical optimization techniques to ensure a targeted approach and serve as an interface between simulation work and experimental efforts. The objective of this work is to assist the bioprocessing industries in evaluating the profitability of different possible production routes and product portfolios while maximizing stakeholder value through global optimization of the supply chain.

      "An unusual occurrence of the coexistence of algae, oxygen and hydrogen sulphide from sulphate-reducing bacteria (SRB) in an overseas groundwater production system is described that had an interesting origin and some important implications both for groundwater professionals and for the water industry in general. A deep, confined anaerobic groundwater source containing SRBs was being pumped to a new municipal water treatment works by underground pipeline from a wellfield some 3 km distant. Pumping continued at a steady rate of around 70 000 m3/d for a period of three months from start-up without significant problems. However, in the fourth month of operation, progressively serious fouling problems appeared in the sand filters that nearly caused a plant shutdown, with the consequent near loss of supply of a major drinking water source for a nearby city. This paper describes the cause of those problems and highlights both the complex chain of events and the biochemical interactions involved, with particular emphasis on the unusual coexistence of SRBs and algae in a groundwater system. This apparent paradox is explained in terms of an unfolding sequence of seemingly unconnected events with a rather surprising origin.\n",

      "Hydrogen sulphide is known to be a potent inhibitor of the respiratory chain and leads to a depression of aerobic metabolism. Organisms living in sulphidic habitats such as shallow coastal water inlets have to cope with its toxic effects. In the Southern Baltic the species Marenzelleria viridis, native to brackish water habitats in North-East America has proliferated rapidly and become a characteristic faunal element. The polytrophic conditions cause a high concentration of sulphide in the sediment, where the animals inhabit J-shaped burrows. Since H2S is thought to depress aerobic metabolism, the metabolic rate of the animal was investigated by means of direct and indirect calorimetry. The heat production of adults was significantly enhanced when exposed to sulphide (250 μmol 1−1) and hypoxic conditions. In addition larvae of M. viridis increased their metabolic rate in the presence of sulphide if oxygen supply was sufficient. In the absence of oxygen the heat dissipation was only slightly raised reflecting different detoxification processes in the presence and absence of oxygen. The enhanced metabolic rate at hypoxic, sulfidic conditions may be due to detoxification processes which are coupled with an energy gaining system used by the animal itself or which may be associated with bacteria.\n",

      "Simple logistics strategies such as “carry-along” and Earth-based “resupply” were sufficient for past human space programs. Next-generation space logistics paradigms are expected to be more complex, involving multiple exploration destinations and in situ resource utilization. Optional in situ resource utilization brings additional complexity to the interplanetary supply chain network design problem. This paper presents an interdependent network flow modeling method for determining optimal logistics strategies for space exploration and its application to the human exploration of Mars. It is found that a strategy using lunar resources in the cislunar network may improve overall launch mass to low Earth orbit for recurring missions to Mars compared to NASA’s Mars Design Reference Architecture 5.0, even when including the mass of the in situ resource utilization infrastructures that need to be predeployed. Other findings suggest that chemical propulsion using liquid oxygen/liquid hydrogen, lunar in situ resource utilization water production, and the use of aerocapture significantly contribute to reducing launch mass from Earth. A sensitivity analysis of in situ resource utilization reveals that, under the given assumptions, local lunar resources become attractive at productivity levels above 1.8 kg/year/kg in the context of future human exploration of Mars.\n",

      "The Fuel Cells and Hydrogen Joint Undertaking (FCH JU) was set up in 2008 to accelerate the development of fuel cells and hydrogen technologies in Europe towards commercialization from 2015 onwards. To reach this target the FCH JU intends to bring together resources under a cohesive public-private partnership to ensure commercial focus, to match RTD activities to industry's needs and expectations and to scale-up and intensify links between the Industry Community and the Research Community. The applications are open to all fuel cells technologies, SOFC being mostly developed for the stationary applications, including back-up powers and APUs for transportation (trucks, planes). Applications are also open to SOEC technologies. There are different groups working in Europe and supported partially by the FCH JU on the SOFC/SOEC technologies. By supporting such a project portfolio, FCH JU is going to reach most of the objectives set-up at European level mainly in terms of potential reduction of costs through sufficient number of units demonstrated across Europe in transport, stationary and hydrogen production applications. The EU public support continues for the period of 2014-2020 for activities with an advanced TRL, moving towards market penetration of the FCH technologies. As a public-private partnership, the FCH JU has enabled a range of businesses and industry, in particular SMEs, and research communities to commit to longer term developments. It has fostered an impressive level of collaboration between the research and industry community. This unique public-private partnership is already supporting research and demonstration projects in the different areas of application of fuel cells and hydrogen (i.e. 38-39% in transportation and related refuelling infrastructure, with additional 15-16% for the hydrogen production routes and associated storage and distribution paths; 30-31% in stationary applications, mainly for combined heat and power generation in residential and industrial applications; 7-8% for early market applications like forklifts, back-up powers and 3-4% for support activities in terms of RCS, education and promotion/awareness of these technologies) and 5-6% for overarching activities covering more than one of the areas just mentioned. The applications are open to all fuel cells technologies, SOFC being mostly developed for the stationary applications, including back-up powers and APUs for transportation (trucks, plains). The €732 million in grants already allocated under FCH1JU and FCH2JU to 204 projects (around half of this have already been completed) have contributed to bring some applications near to market readiness (e.g. passenger vehicles, material handling, back-up power systems, and portable power generation). However, taking to market those applications with the strongest potential for addressing energy security and climate change issues (e.g. road transport, public urban transport, stationary power generation, combined heat and power, hydrogen from renewable energy sources and electricity storage) requires both further key technical developments and demonstrations to achieve large scale production volumes fast. So far € 176 million have been allocated to support 48 projects which address specifically the SOFC or SOEC technologies (almost 40% of the energy-type of projects); these projects cover the whole value chain in the Energy systems from long-term and breakthrough orientated research (degradation and lifetime fundamentals related to materials and typical operation environments for relevant power ranges) to technology validation (proof-of-concept fuel cell and electrolyser systems and their interactions with supply & demand interfaces i.e. other power generation devices, cooling/heating systems, and with the infrastructure i.e. grid interface, fuel supply and local power output) and market capacity building across all applications (full scale field demonstrations of proven systems in real end user environment), including 4 projects addressing APU for transportation (e.g. trucks) and 1 project dealing with the development test procedures for SOC cell/stack assembly. The proposed paper will provide an update on the current status of the above mentioned FCH JU funded projects, on the outcomes achieved to date and on the expected results still to come.\n",

      "Rates of pyrolysis of a range of 1-aryl-1-methylethyl acetates, measured between 590.8 and 529.6 K, give a very good correlation with σ+ values. The ρ factor (–0.743 at 550 K) is almost exactly the same as in pyrolysis of the much less reactive 1-arylethyl acetates and this contrasts with SN1 solvolyses of the corresponding chlorides where increased electron supply by the methyl groups to the side-chain α-carbocation produces less demand for stabilisation of the transition state by the aryl substituents and a smaller ρ factor. In the elimination the cation is only partially formed and the electron supply from the extra methyl groups of the tertiary esters facilitates C–O bond breakage and a more polar transition state; the opposing effects of the methyl substituents therefore produce no nett change in ρ factor. The transition-state charge difference is confirmed by the (statistically corrected) tertiary: secondary reactivity ratio of 77 which is much greater, relative to the ρ factor, than the difference between the rates of SN1 solvolysis of the corresponding tertiary and secondary chlorides. The meta methyl substituent is confirmed as being of exceptional polarisability in the absence of solvent; in both the present reaction and phenyl carbonate pyrolysis a σ+ value of –0.13 is required to correlate its effect. The reactivity of 1-(2-pyridyl)-1-methylethyl acetate is less than predicted from the corresponding data for 1-arylethyl acetates and 1-arylethyl methyl carbonates, and reasons for this are considered. This anomaly apart, data from all three ester types confirm that the σ+ values for the pyridine free base are (positions in parentheses): 0.77(2), 0.295(3), and 0.86(4) and that the larger values obtained in most solution reactions refer to the hydrogen-bonded species.\n",

The accurate binding domain of phenosafranine in protein has been characterized from molecular modeling, subdomain IIIA of HSA and Trp-62, Trp-63 and Trp-108 residues of Lys was designated to possess high-affinity for this compound, the dominant forces in the protein–phenosafranine adduct are hydrogen bonds and π–π interactions, but hydrophobic interactions between dye and Lys are also not exclude. The data of fluorescence displayed that the complex of phenosafranine with protein produces quenching through static property, this corroborates the time-resolved fluorescence results that the ground state complex formation with a moderate affinity of 104 M−1. Moreover, via synchronous fluorescence, CD and three-dimensional fluorescence we indicated some extent of polypeptide chain of protein partially unfolding upon conjugation with phenosafranine. Through this work, we anticipate it can supply salient clues on the toxicological action of phenosafranine and other azines, which have analogous configuration with phenosafranine.\n",

      "Quantum computing and simulations are creating transformative opportunities by exploiting the principles of quantum mechanics in new ways to generate and process information. It is expected that a variety of areas ranging from day-to-day activities to making advanced scientific discoveries are going to benefit from such computations. Several early stage applications of quantum computing and simulation have already been demonstrated, and these preliminary results show that quantum computing and simulations could significantly accelerate the deployment of new technologies urgently needed to meet the growing demand for energy while safeguarding the environment. Exciting examples include developing new materials such as alloys, catalysts, oxygen carriers, CO2 sorbents/solvents, and energy storage materials; optimizing traffic flows and energy supply chains; locating energy generation facilities such as wind and solar farms and fossil and nuclear power plants; designing pipeline networks for transporting hydrogen, natural gas, and CO2; and speeding up tasks such as seismic imaging and inversion, reservoir simulation, and computational fluid dynamics. In this review, we introduce different aspects of quantum computing and simulations and discuss the status of theoretical and experimental approaches. We then specifically highlight a growing number of application areas in the energy sector. We conclude by providing an analysis of high-value application directions to address energy sector challenges.\n",

      "Converting wind energy into ammonia (WtA) has been recognized as a promising pathway to produce green ammonia compared with traditional coal-based technologies. As the key part of WtA, Power-to-Ammonia (PtA) has great potential to facilitate the usage of wind generation. This paper proposes a co-planning approach for regional wind resources-based ammonia industry and the electric network (EN). To this end, PtA is first modeled as a flexible power load of power systems with spatial and temporal constraints on hydrogen supply chains (HSC). Then a novel co-planning model of WtA and EN is established to optimize the WtA configuration and the EN expansion. An alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) based algorithm is introduced to effectively solve this model. Real data of Inner Mongolia Province in China is adopted to verify the effectiveness and significance of the proposed approach. It is shown that the siting and operation flexibility of PtA with HSC can reduce the expansion burden of EN. The co-planning of WtA and EN can significantly enhance wind power utilization and reduce total investment costs. Furthermore, feasibility analysis on WtA in comparison with coal-to-ammonia (CtA) and ultra-high voltage transmission (UHV) provides helpful guidelines for the realization of WtA.\n",

      "Pericarp browning is known as one of the leading problems during the supply chains of litchi fruit. The effects of pre-storage kojic acid (KA) application on pericarp browning, activities of antioxidative enzymes in the pericarp tissues, and the quality attributes, soluble solid concentrations, titratable acidity and ascorbic acid concentrations of the flesh of ‘Gola’ litchis have been investigated. Fruit were treated with 2, 4 or 6mmolL−1 KA and stored at 5±1°C with 90±5% relative humidity for 20 d. Fruit treated with 4mmolL−1 KA had reduced fruit weight loss and fruit decay; while, 6mmolL−1 KA delayed pericarp browning by maintaining higher total anthocyanin and phenolic concentrations, and 2, 2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging activity. Reduced malondialdehyde, and hydrogen peroxide concentrations, and activities of oxidative enzymes such as peroxidase and polyphenol oxidase were also observed in 6mmolL−1 KA-treated fruit. In contrast, activities of ascorbate peroxidase, catalase and superoxide dismutase enzymes were found to be higher in pericarp tissues of fruit subjected to 6mmolL−1 KA application. Moreover, soluble solid concentrations, titratable acidity, ascorbic acid concentrations and sensory characteristics were also higher in 6mmolL−1 KA-treated litchi fruit. In conclusion, pre-storage application of 6mmolL−1 KA to litchi fruit delayed pericarp browning and maintained activities of antioxidative enzymes.\n",

      "In Germany more than 20% of the energy mix is made up of renewable energy and its share is rapidly increasing. The federal government expects renewables to account for 35% of Germany's electricity consumption by 2020, 50% by 2030 and 80% by 2050. According to the German Energy Agency, multi-billion euro investments in energy storage are expected by 2020 in order to reach these goals. The growth of this fluctuating energy supply has created demand for innovative storage options in Germany and it is accelerating the development of technologies in this field. Along with batteries and smart grids, hydrogen is expected to be one of the lead technologies. 2010 a commercialization roadmap for wind hydrogen was set up by the two northern federal states of Hamburg and Schleswig-Holstein with the goal of utilizing surplus wind power for the electrolytic production of hydrogen. With the creation of the “performing energy initiative”, 2011, Brandenburg and Lower Saxony joined this undertaking. The aim of this initiative is to set up demonstration projects in order to develop and optimize wind-hydrogen hybrid systems and prepare their commercialization for the time after 2020. Beside the conversion of hydrogen into electricity and fuel for cars, further markets like raw material for the chemical, petrochemical, metallurgy and food industry are going to be addressed. Considering the fact there are over 40 caves currently used for natural gas storage with a total volume of 23.5 billion cubic meters and 400 000 km gas grid available in Germany, the German Technical and Scientific Association for Gas and Water sees opportunities for hydrogen to be fed into the existing natural gas grid network. The name of this concept is power-to-gas. According to the current DVGW-Standards natural gas in Germany can contain up to 5% hydrogen. The GERG, European Group on the Gas Research sees potential to increase this amount up to 6% to 20%. Power-to-gas could serve both for fuel and for the storage of extra energy produced by renewable sources. The hydrogen produced via electrolysis could be drawn upon – directly or as synthetic natural gas (SNG) in a second additional methanation process step – to provide electricity by means of CCGT (combined cycle gas turbines) or CHP (combined heat and power) using for example fuel cells. It could also address the industrial and household heat market. DVGW is furthermore participating in the “Power-to-Gas Platform” that was set up in 2012 by the German Energy Agency, bringing together RnD institutes, renewable energy project developers and park operators, utilities, underground storage providers in order to create political support for this new technology. Demonstration projects will be completed by 2020 in order to develop business models (for storage, production and trade of “green gas”) and devices (electrolysers, turbines, smart gas metering, compressors, storage capacities amongst others) to enable the implementation of this concept on a broad scale. This means that a multitude of industrial players will be involved in the changes that will occur in the value chain: utilities (electricity, gas), power technology companies, car makers, heating device manufacturers, but also manufacturers of measurement, regulation and control devices, suppliers of the biogas and methanation industry. Germany is the pioneer in this field. This technology however increasingly interests its neighbours, with project developments in France, Italy, Spain, and UK but also in North America and North Africa. Germany can contribute its valuable experience (e.g. legal framework for power-to-gas) to the development of these industries. German participants in demonstration projects in these countries could for example be renewable energy park operators, RnD institutes and suppliers.\n",

      " \n",
      "A one‐dimensional, vertically resolved, physical‐biogeochemical model is used to provide a unified representation of the dynamically coupled oxic‐suboxic‐anoxic system for the interior Black Sea. The model relates the annual cycle of plankton production in the form of a series of successive phytoplankton, mesozooplankton, and higher consumer blooms to organic matter generation and to the remineralization‐ammonification‐nitrification‐denitrification chain of the nitrogen cycle as well as to anaerobic sulfide oxidation in the suboxic‐anoxic interface zone. The simulations indicate that oxygen consumption during remineralization and nitrification, together with a lack of ventilation of subsurface waters due to the presence of strong stratification, are the two main factors limiting aerobic biogeochemical activity to the upper ∼75 m of the water column, which approximately corresponds to the level of nitrate maximum. The position of the upper boundary and thus the thickness of the suboxic layer are controlled by upper layer biological processes. The quasi‐permanent character of this layer and the stability of the suboxic‐anoxic interface within the last several decades are maintained by a constant rate of nitrate supply from the nitrate maximum zone. Nitrate is consumed to oxidize sinking particulate organic matter as well as hydrogen sulfide and ammonium transported upward from deeper levels.\n",

      "Hydrogen sulfide (H2S), which is produced by astrocytes in the central nervous system, inhibits the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC). We have previously shown that H2S releases Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in spinal cord astrocytes. Here, we examined the relationship between H2S-induced metabolic changes and Ca2+ response. Intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) in cultured rat spinal cord astrocytes was measured using Fura 2-AM. Na2S was used as a H2S donor. The extracellular lactate and intracellular ATP were measured by enzymatic reaction using lactate dehydrogenase and luciferase, respectively.Na2S (150 µM) increased [Ca2+]i, which was inhibited by rotenone, an ETC inhibitor, and FCCP, an uncoupler of oxidative phosphorylation. Na2S also increased extracellular lactate, and decreased intracellular ATP content when glycolysis was inhibited by iodoacetic acid. The increase in both Ca2+ and extracellular lactate by Na2S were inhibited by emetine, an inhibitor of translocon complex, which mediates Ca2+ leak from the ER.In conclusion, inhibition of the mitochondrial ETC by H2S induces Ca2+ release from the ER and lactate production in spinal cord astrocytes. H2S may facilitate the supply of lactate from astrocytes to neurons as an energy substrate.\n",

      " \n",
      "The torrefaction of biomass is a thermochemical process based on the de composition of hemicellulose, which is the dominant reaction, while the cellulose and lignin fractions remain almost unaffected. Torrefaction of biomass improves its physical properties like grindability, particle shape, size, and distribution, pelletability, and composition properties like moisture, carbon and hydrogen contents, and calorific value. The already higher energy density can be increased further by a pelletizing step after torrefaction. These improved properties make torrefied biomass particularly suitable for co-firing in power plants. Co-firing biomass with fossil fuels is one of the solutions to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions of existing power plants. Several studies on torrefaction of biomass for heat and power applications have been documented in the literature, which need to be reviewed and analyzed for further actions in the field, because significant gaps remain in the understanding of the biomass torrefaction process, which necessitate further study, mainly concerning the characterization of the torrefaction chemical reactions, investigation of equipment performance and design, and elucidation of supply chain impacts. This is the main objective of the present review study, which consists in three parts. The first part focuses on the mechanism of biomass torrefaction. It is followed by a review of biomass co-firing with coal. Finally, market opportunities for the process are discussed.\n",

      "Commercial water electrolysis technologies, including proton exchange membrane electrolysis (PEMWE), are the only renewable hydrogen generation technologies that can achieve the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) cost targets within the next ten years at the required scale, based on the supply chain maturity and materials performance. In particular, membrane and electrode modifications have enabled the use of advanced electrolysis membranes to achieve the efficiency targets, while nanoengineered alloy catalyst layers (CLs) have been pursued to meet the cost and efficiency targets. These advancements have been achieved by building the basic understanding to allow the successful technical development and include: (1) Mechanical and chemical understanding of membranes in liquid water below 90 o C; (2) Characterization of as-deposited electrodes and MEAs after operation; (3) Water management in the anode catalyst layer, dependence on catalyst loading and porous transport layer form factor; and (4) Long-term degradation rate and stability of engineered alloy Ru-Ir alloy nanocatalysts in well-defined anode catalyst layers.   Nel Hydrogen’s pathway to meet these DOE goals is through the i) use of 50-75% thinner membranes that operate at 80-90 o C, while controlling mechanical creep and gas crossover; ii) reducing the catalyst loading to 1/10 th the current value on both electrodes, while controlling water distribution and the porous transport layer/catalyst layer (PTL/CL) electrochemical interface; iii) incorporation of a less stable but more active Ru containing catalyst managed on the anode side of the cell, which is achievable with lower voltage operation (accomplished via low ohmic drop in the anode catalyst layer, thinner membranes, and higher temperature operation); and iv) fabricating a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) integrating all of these characteristics.  In this talk, some of the advancements achieved and how these have impacted the cost of hydrogen will be discussed, as well as the longer-term targets that need to be reached to provide the robustness required for commercial applications. Additionally, cost models will be compared along with sensitivity analysis to show how the impact of operating parameters, with regard to the capital and operational expense for the PEM electrolysis technology cost, show the critical areas to focus on to provide the largest impact towards meeting cost target goals and what is required to go beyond.

      "A mixture of 1- and 2-butanol was produced using a stepwise synthesis starting with a methyl halide. The process included a carbon dioxide utilization step to produce an acetate salt which was then converted to the butanol isomers by Claisen condensation of the esterified acetate followed by hydrogenation of the resulting ethyl acetoacetate. Importantly, the CO2 utilization step uses dry, dilute carbon dioxide (12% CO2 in nitrogen) similar to those found in post-combustion flue gases. The work has shown that the Grignard reagent has a slow rate of reaction with oxygen in comparison to carbon dioxide, meaning that the costly purification step usually associated with carbon capture technologies can be omitted using this direct capture-conversion technique. Butanol isomers are useful as direct drop-in replacement fuels for gasoline due to their high octane number, higher energy density, hydrophobicity, and low corrosivity in existing petrol engines. An energy analysis shows the process to be exothermic from methanol to butanol; however, energy is required to regenerate the active magnesium metal from the halide by-product. The methodology is important as it allows electrical energy, which is difficult to store using batteries over long periods of time, to be stored as a liquid fuel that fits entirely with the current liquid fuels infrastructure. This means that renewable, weather-dependent energy can be stored across seasons, for example, production in summer with consumption in winter. It also helps to avoid new fossil carbon entering the supply chain through the utilization of carbon dioxide that would otherwise be emitted. As methanol has also been shown to be commercially produced from CO2, this adds to the prospect of the general decarbonization of the transport fuels sector. Furthermore, as the conversion of CO2 to butanol requires significantly less hydrogen than CO2 to octanes, there is a potentially reduced burden on the so-called hydrogen economy.\n",

      "The current methods for regeneration of NAD+ and NADP+ in dehydrogenase‐catalyzed organic synthesis are not technologically mature due to problems with operational stability, kinetic efficiency or thermodynamic equilibrium. We show here that Candida tenuis xylose reductase converts 9,10‐phenanthrenequinone with good turnover frequency when using NADH (12 s−1) or NADPH (1.6 s−1) as the coenzyme and exhibits high binding affinity for this quinone substrate (Km≤13 μM). Because chemical reaction of the hydroquinone product with dissolved molecular oxygen regenerates the quinone at a rate comparable to that of the enzymatic reduction, a chemo‐enzymatic process is established where the reductase, a catalytic concentration of 9,10‐phenanthrenequinone (25 μM) and molecular oxygen promote efficiently the production of NAD(P)+ from NAD(P)H. Oxidation of the hydroquinone occurs via a radical chain reaction that involves superoxide as the propagating species and yields a molar equivalent of hydrogen peroxide for each 9,10‐phenanthrenequinone recycled. Using the NAD+‐ or NADP+‐dependent transformation of D‐mannitol (25 mM) into D‐fructose as a model transformation, the total turnover numbers for 9,10‐phenanthrenequinone and the coenzyme obtained in a single batchwise conversion were 1000 and ≤125, respectively. The yields of ketose product were quantitative, indicating that molecular oxygen reduction drives the thermodynamically unfavourable synthetic reaction. Oxygen transfer to the liquid phase was shown to be rate‐limiting for the overall process under conditions of surface aeration and bubble‐free molecular oxygen supply. Xylose reductase was fully stable during the reaction (25 °C, pH 8.0). The novel chemo‐enzymatic system should therefore be broadly applicable to biocatalytic synthesis with isolated dehydrogenases utilizing NAD+ or NADP+.

      "Historical methods of cleaning up petroleum hydrocarbons from the vadose zone, the capillary zone, and the aquifers are not technically true cleanup technologies but rather transfer techniques. In addition, environmental engineers are realizing that the standard remediation techniques are not entirely effective in removing the hazardous material in a reasonable time frame. Long-chain hydrocarbons such as kerosene, diesel, and waste oil are particularly difficult to remediate using conventional techniques. The use of bioremediation as an alternative remediation technology is fast becoming the technique of choice among many environmental professionals. This method offers substantial benefits not found in other remediation processes. Bioremediation is very cost effective, nondestructive, relatively uncomplicated in imple menting, requires nonspecialized equipment, and can be extremely effective in removing recalcitrant petroleum hydrocarbons. This study researched the availability of viable microbial populations in the arid climate in South Dakota. Exponential growth of the bacteria and the ability of bacteria to degrade long-chain hydrocarbons indicated that healthy populations do exist and could be used to mineralize organic hydrocarbons. Experimental results indicated that bioremediation can be effectively enhanced in landfills as well as in the subsurface using a supply of harmless nutrients. The biodegradation rate can be further enhanced with the use of edible surfactant that helped disperse the petroleum products. Also, the use of hydrogen peroxide enhanced the oxygen availability and increased the degradation rate. Interestingly, the bacterial growth rate was found to be high in difficult-to-biodegrade contaminants, such as waste oil. A numerical simulation program was also developed that describes the bacterial growth in the subsurface along with the reduction in substrate (contamination). Results from this program were found to be consistent with laboratory results. Finally, large-scale laboratory tests were performed. A comparison of these two sets of results revealed an interesting scaling correlation. Recommendations are made for proper scaling up of laboratory results.\n",

      "Native cotton and commercial viscose rayon were degraded by using a saturated solution of hydrogen chloride (about 43%) in methanol at 0° C. It was found that, on the average, 8.1 bonds in native cotton suffered methanolysis during the first 6 hrs. of the reaction, whereas in the ensuing period of 666 hrs. only 1.6 bonds became cleaved. The results indicate that the initial reaction comes to a practical standstill after about the same stage of degradation has been reached as in the mild hydrolytic scission of the same materials (D.P. ∼ 250 for cotton, and D.P. ∼ 60 for viscose rayon). In order to gain information as to the nature of the methoxyl groups in the methanolyzed products, a study of the rate of hydrolysis of the latter was made. Evidently, if the classical concept of cellulose structure is correct—that is, if only normal methyl. glucopyranoside end groups are present—then the rate of acid hydrolysis, as measured by the increase in the reducing power, should be of the order of magnitude shown by the normal methyl glucopyranosides. On the other hand, a very fast rate of hydrolysis, which is characteristic for the open-chain dimethyl acetals of the sugars, would constitute evidence for the presence of such types of residues; hence, it would favor the new concept of cellulose structure. The results showed that more than one-half of the material in the case of viscose rayon and about one-half in that of native cotton were hydrolyzed by 0.05N HCl at 60°C in a period of 48 hrs., which is shorter beyond all comparison than the half-life (3,450 hrs.) of methyl α-gluco pyranoside under identical conditions. These results are considered to supply the chemical proof for the presence of the acid-sensitive, open-chain glucose residues which were suggested in the new formula for cellulose.\n",

      "Das Energiesystem steht vor einem grundlegenden Wandel: Ein System, das auf die konstante Bereitstellung durch fossile Energieträger ausgerichtet ist, soll durch die umfangreiche Integration erneuerbarer Energien eine nachhaltigere Energieversorgung gewährleisten. Die Herausforderung des Systemwechsels macht sich gegenwärtig in der Stromversorgung am deutlichsten bemerkbar, betrifft aber alle Bereiche des Energiesystems, wenn auch mit unterschiedlichen Auswirkungen. Im Energiesystem werden Energie und/oder Energieträger räumlich von Energieversorgungsnetzen verteilt, während die bedarfsgerechte Bereitstellung gegenwärtig dafür sorgt, dass der Energiebedarf zu jeder Zeit gedeckt wird. Energie aus erneuerbaren Quellen wird in der Regel nicht bedarfsgerecht bereitgestellt; ihr Anteil steigt. Energiespeicher sind eine Möglichkeit, das zeitlich versetzte Angebot mit der Nachfrage zur Deckung zu bringen. Energiespeicher sind Systeme, die eine Energiemenge kontrolliert aufnehmen, sie über einen im Kontext relevanten Zeitraum in einem Speichermedium zurückhalten und mit zeitlicher Verzögerung wieder kontrolliert abgeben können. Zu den Energiespeichern gehören nach dieser Definition auch Verfahrensketten, die diese Aspekte durch eine Kombination verschiedener Technologien abbilden. Als mechanische Großspeicher für elektrischen Strom dienen heute fast ausschließlich Pumpwasserspeicherkraftwerke, die zukünftig durch Druckluftspeicherkraftwerke und eventuell Luftzerlegungsanlagen ergänzt werden könnten. Im Bereich der elektrochemischen Energiespeicher befinden sich verschiedene Technologien im Forschungs-, Entwicklungs- und/oder Demonstrationsstadium für einen Einsatz in der stationären großtechnischen Stromspeicherung. Thermische Speichertechnologien beruhen auf der Speicherung von sensibler Wärme, der Ausnutzung von Phasenübergängen, Adsorption-/Desorptionsprozessen oder chemischen Reaktionen, die prinzipiell eine dauerhafte und verlustfreie Speicherung von Wärme ermöglichen können. Die Speicherung von Energie in Form chemischer Bindungen in stofflichen Speichern verläuft über Substanzen, die selbst als Energieträger oder Chemikalien verwendet werden können; sie befinden sich damit in direkter Konkurrenz zu alternativen Bereitstellungs- und Nutzungsvarianten. Die Schlüsseltechnologie hierbei ist auf absehbare Zeit die Elektrolyse von Wasser zu Wasserstoff und Sauerstoff. Wasserstoff kann wiederum durch verschiedene Verfahren in andere Energieträger umgewandelt werden. So lässt er sich in verschiedenen Sektoren des Energiesystems und/oder in energieintensiven Industrieprozessen stofflich nutzen. Teilfunktionen von Energiespeichern können auch von Industrieprozessen wahrgenommen werden. Dem Energiesystem in seiner Gesamtheit eröffnen sich neue Optionen, die bisher weitgehend getrennten Energieversorgungsströme zu verknüpfen und zu vernetzen. Neben der Möglichkeit, verstärkt erneuerbare Energien außerhalb des Stromsektors zu nutzen, ergeben sich auch neue Bedingungen für eine verstärkte Flexibilisierung, neuartige Synergieeffekte und zusätzliche Optimierungsmöglichkeiten. Anhand verschiedener Referenzfälle wird der mögliche Einsatz von Speichertechnologien aufgezeigt und bewertet. The current energy system is subject to a profound change: A system, designed to cater to energy needs by supplying fossil fuels is now expected to shift to integrate ever larger amounts of renewable energies to achieve overall a more sustainable energy supply. The challenges arising from this paradigm change are currently most obvious in the area of electric power supply. However, it affects the entire energy system, albeit with different effects. Within the energy system, various independent grids fulfill the function to transport and distribute energy or energy carriers in order to address spatially different energy supply and demand situations. Temporal variations are currently addressed by just-in-time production of the required energy form. However, renewable energy sources generally supply their energy independently from any specific energy demand. Their contribution to the overall energy system is expected to increase significantly. Energy storage technologies also represent an option to compensate for a temporal difference in energy supply and demand. Energy storage systems have the ability for a controlled take-up of a certain amount of energy, storing this energy within a storage media on a relevant timescale and a controlled redispatch of the energy after a certain time delay. Energy storage systems can also be constructed as process chains by combinations of unit operations, each covering different aspects of those functions. Large-scale mechanical storage options for electrical power are currently almost exclusively pumped hydro storage. These systems might be complemented in the future by compressed-air storage and maybe liquid-air facilities. There are several electrochemical storage technologies currently under investigation for their suitability as large scale electrical energy storage in various stages of research, development, and demonstration. Thermal energy storage technologies are based on a large variety of storage principles: Sensible heat, latent heat (based on phase transitions), adsorption/desorption processes or on chemical reactions. The latter can be a route to permanent and loss-free storage of heat. Chemical energy storage systems are based on the energy contained within the chemical bonds of the respective storage molecules. These storage molecules can act as energy carriers. Equally well, these compounds can enter various industrial value chains in energy-intensive industrial sectors and are therefore in direct economic competition with established (fossil) supply routes for these compounds. Water electrolysis, producing hydrogen and oxygen, is and will be the key technology for the foreseeable future. Hydrogen can be transformed by various processes to other energy carriers of interest. These transformations make the stored energy accessible by different sectors of the energy system and/or as raw materials for energy-intensive industrial processes. Some functions of energy storage systems can be taken over by industrial processes. Within the overall energy system, chemical energy storage technologies open up opportunities to link, connect and interweave the various energy streams and sectors. While chemical energy storage offers a route for a stronger integration of renewable energy outside the power sector, it also creates new opportunities for increased flexibility, novel synergies and additional optimization. Several examples of specific energy utilization are discussed and evaluated with respect to energy storage applications.\n",

      "Water electrolysis supplied by renewable energy is the foremost technology for producing “green” hydrogen for fuel cell vehicles. In addition, the ability to rapidly follow an intermittent load makes electrolysis an ideal solution for grid-balancing caused by differences in supply and demand for energy generation and consumption. Membrane-electrode assemblies (MEAs) designed for polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) water electrolysis, based on a novel short-side chain (SSC) perfluorosulfonic acid (PFSA) membrane, Aquivion®, with various cathode and anode noble metal loadings, were investigated in terms of both performance and durability. Utilizing a nanosized Ir0.7Ru0.3Ox solid solution anode catalyst and a supported Pt/C cathode catalyst, in combination with the Aquivion® membrane, gave excellent electrolysis performances exceeding 3.2A·cm−2 at 1.8V terminal cell voltage (∼80% efficiency) at 90°C in the presence of a total catalyst loading of 1.6mg⋅cm−2. A very small loss of efficiency, corresponding to 30mV voltage increase, was recorded at 3A⋅cm−2 using a total noble metal catalyst loading of less than 0.5mg·cm−2 (compared to the industry standard of 2mg·cm−2). Steady-state durability tests, carried out for 1000h at 1A⋅cm−2, showed excellent stability for the MEA with total noble metal catalyst loading of 1.6mg·cm−2 (cell voltage increase ∼5μV/h). Moderate degradation rate (cell voltage increase ∼15μV/h) was recorded for the low loading 0.5mg·cm−2, MEA. Similar stability characteristics were observed in durability tests at 3A·cm−2. These high performance and stability characteristics were attributed to the enhanced proton conductivity and good stability of the novel membrane, the optimized structural properties of the Ir and Ru oxide solid solution and the enrichment of Ir species on the surface for the anodic catalyst.\n",

      "LNG and Cruise Ships, an Easy Way to Fulfil Regulations—Versus the Need for Reducing GHG Emissions\n",

      " \n",
      "Liquified natural gas (LNG), with its low sulphur content, its favorable hydrogen-to-carbon ratio, and the lower nitrogen oxide emission when combusted compared to conventional fuels, fulfils all International Maritime Organization (IMO) air emission regulations. For the cruise industry, with their large number of customers and their high public visibility, LNG has therefore become a tempting option for new cruise ships. However, larger well-to-tank (WTT) emissions for the LNG supply chain as well as un-combusted methane (CH4) from the ship’s engine might more than nullify any greenhouse gas (GHG) gains. Previous studies have shown very different GHG impacts from the use of LNG as a ship fuel. With climate change potentially being the largest threat to mankind, it is important that decisions with an impact on future GHG emissions are based on the best available knowledge within a sector and across sectors. The motivation for this study has therefore been to establish comparable GHG estimates for well-to-wake (WTW) emissions for LNG and traditional fuels in a transparent way. The results show that there is a need for adopting policies that can reduce the broader GHG emissions of shipping instead of CO2 only, including the well-to-tank emissions of ship fuels. If not, we might end up with a large number of ships with GHG savings on paper only, while the real GHG emissions increases.\n",

      " \n",
      "Ongoing research in sustainable battery technologies aims to implement the sodium-ion battery (SIB) as a lower-cost alternative to the lithium-ion battery (LIB), thus reducing the susceptibility of materials to volatility in the supply chain and resource scarcity. However, delving into the design paradigm for a stable cathode host material for efficient SIBs is highly challenging because of the greater radius of sodium ions in comparison to lithium. This study explores the chemical and electrochemical sodium-ion coordination properties of tetrakislawsone (TKL), a tetrameric derivative of the lawsone molecule responsible for the dye properties of henna. TKL exhibits stable capacity in electrolytes with facile and reversible Na-ion coupled redox, allowing it to maintain its performance over hundreds of cycles of charging and discharging. Characterization of the Na-ion coordination mechanism in TKL was performed with solid-state NMR and DFT computations, in conjunction with other spectroscopic methods. It was demonstrated that the chemical binding of Na ions occurs via an eight-membered coordination sphere between hydrogen bonded hydroxyl and carbonyl functional groups, forming an interface across two distinct lawsone subunits. This process is accommodated by the three-dimensional structuring of TKL wherein the lawsone units shift out of plane from the aromatic core. This nature-inspired SIB cathode material provides avenues to build fast, stable, high-capacity electrodes using organic molecular systems.\n",

      "10.22190/fuwlep1701001s\n",
      " \n",
      "The organic fraction of municipal waste (MW) is a huge resource of nutrients and energy, primarily because of the high content of carbon as well as potassium and phosphorus. On the other hand, having in mind the problems that cities are faced with, such as energy supply, transportation, environmental pollution and many others, waste management has to be considered as an integral part of city management. Circular economy is a new concept of thinking which implies that all streams of a system should be considered as a possible resource, including waste. The organic part of municipal waste can be used in several ways. Anaerobic digestion (AD) that produces biogas and compost can be a part of the chain of circular economy of a city. This paper deals with the organic waste generated on the territory of the city of Nis with the focus on its potential in terms of carbon, hydrogen and mineral content. Based on the elementary analysis and quantity of waste, the streams of carbon and other elements that circulate through waste, biogas and compost have also been analyzed. Moreover, energy needs for AD function and transportation of both MW and compost are calculated. The analysis shows that the energy produced by AD can cover the energy needs for the proposed model, and the amount of produced compost is enough to recover nutrients on the majority of green yards in the city.\n",

      " \n",
      "In food supply chain, there are regulatory limitations on the use of chemicals for cleaning processing lines since the healthiness of the commodities must be guaranteed if accidently traces of these detergents and sanitizers pass to them. Hydrogen peroxide, is a commonly used sanitizer in the cleaning of the food processing lines having both bactericidal and bacteriostatic properties, however, it produces inflammatory effects on the human body. The availability of rapid systems to detect its accidental presence is therefore useful to speed up the control and apply corrective actions. In the present work, a drop casting and easily prepared plastic graphite/PVC electrode decorated with NiO nanostructures has been investigated as electrochemical sensor for the non-enzymatic amperometric determination of H2O2. The catalytic activity, dispersion, and stability of NiO nanostructures mixed with plastic nanocomposite electrode have been studied in detail. The preparation method, particularly the precipitating agents used in the synthesis of NiO nanostructures strongly influenced their morphology and porosity. Further, the electrochemical response of NiO-PE electrodes towards H2O2 resulted to be morphology-dependent. The non-enzymatic electrochemical sensor was optimized for the rapid and sensitive detection of H2O2 present in milk with no sample pre-treatments. NiO nanoflowers showed the best catalytic activity towards H2O2, a linear range that extends up to 4 mM and a LOD of 5 μM (3sd of the blank signal) were obtained.\n",

      "The purpose of this paper is to explore the influence of the new Ukrainian and European regulatory framework for 2019-2020 concerning the decarburization of economy of the functioning of Ukrainian gas industry. The paper provides an overview of the Ukrainian regulatory framework of 2019–2020 on the implementation of the system of monitoring, reporting, and verification of greenhouse gas emissions in our country. We also provide an overview of new European documents on the decarbonisation of economy, in particular, the European Green Deal, the EU Strategy for Reducing Methane Emissions, and the Hydrogen Strategy for Climate-Neutral Europe. We showed that these EU documents will exert a significant influence on the functioning of both the energy sector of our country as a whole and its part – gas industry. The paper shows that, under the existing plans of the development of energy sector in European countries in order to reach the state where there are no net emissions of greenhouse gases by 2050 and under conditions of fierce competition for sources and routes of gas supply to the European market, the most pressing problem confronting the gas transportation system of Ukraine is to optimize its structure with simultaneous replacement of outdated compressor equipment by modern one with lower carbon dioxide emissions, which will require a significant amount of investment. Under such conditions, it is necessary to study carefully the feasibility of introducing activities for the main transportation of gas under the action of Greenhouse Gas Trading System. We also showed that the reduction of methane emissions along the natural gas chain supply in accordance with the EU Strategy for the reduction of methane emissions is extremely important for Ukraine. In addition to the implementation of measures for reducing these emissions, it is necessary to attract attention to the development of national methods for estimating methane emissions and the use of national coefficients in the formation of the National Greenhouse gas emissions inventory for estimating volatile emissions from natural gas activities.\n",

      "On the use of weighting in LCA: translating decision makers’ preferences into weights via linear programming\n",
      "10.1007/s11367-012-0540-6\n",
      " \n",
      "PurposeThe main goal of any life cycle assessment (LCA) study is to identify solutions leading to environmental savings. In conventional LCA studies, practitioners select from some alternatives the one which better matches their preferences. This task is sometimes simplified by ranking these alternatives using an aggregated indicator defined by attaching weights to impacts. We address here the inverse problem. That is, given an alternative, we aim to determine the weights for which that solution becomes optimal.MethodsWe propose a method based on linear programming (LP) that determines, for a given alternative, the ranges within which the weights attached to a set of impact metrics must lie so that when a weighting combination of these impacts is optimized, the alternative can be optimal, while if the weights fall outside this range, it is guaranteed that the solution will be suboptimal. A large weight value implies that the corresponding LCA impact is given more importance, while a low value implies the converse. Furthermore, we provide a rigorous mathematical analysis on the implications of using weighting schemes in LCA, showing that this practice guides decision-making towards the adoption of some specific alternatives (those lying on the convex envelope of the resulting trade-off curve).Results and discussionA case study based on the design of hydrogen infrastructures is taken as a test bed to illustrate the capabilities of the approach presented. Given are a set of production and storage technologies available to produce and deliver hydrogen, a final demand, and cost and environmental data. A set of designs, each achieving a unique combination of cost and LCA impact, is considered. For each of them, we calculate the minimum and maximum weight to be given to every LCA impact so that the alternative can be optimal among all the candidate designs. Numerical results show that solutions with lower impact are selected when decision makers are willing to pay larger monetary penalties for the environmental damage caused.ConclusionsLP can be used in LCA to translate the decision makers’ preferences into weights. This information is rather valuable, particularly when these weights represent economic penalties, as it allows screening and ranking alternatives on the basis of a common economic basis. Our framework is aimed at facilitating decision making in LCA studies and defines a general framework for comparing alternatives that show different performance in a wide variety of impact metrics.\n",

      "Life Cycle Assessment of Carbon Capture and Utilization for the Production of Large Volume Organic Chemicals\n",
      "10.3389/fclim.2020.586199\n",
      " \n",
      "The combination of carbon capture and utilization (CCU) and water electrolysis technologies can be used for the production of basic chemicals from carbon dioxide (CO2) and hydrogen. Here, we present a life cycle assessment (LCA) on a cradle-to-gate basis for the production of the following large volume organic chemicals: methanol, ethylene, propylene, benzene, toluene, and mixed xylenes. Investigated process chains comprise the following technologies: CO2 capture from an industrial point-source or from the atmosphere through direct air capture (DAC); alkaline water electrolysis for hydrogen production; methanol synthesis; methanol-to-olefins and methanol-to-aromatics synthesis including aromatics separation. Electricity is supplied by offshore wind turbines. The system boundary includes all relevant processes from cradle to gate. A scenario was set up by exchanging the background processes for the production of important infrastructure materials like aluminum, copper, steel, and concrete with future processes that are less resource intensive, less carbon intensive and include higher recycling rates (e.g., electric arc furnaces for steel production). LCA results show that the synthesis of the investigated chemicals from CCU processes will reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 88–97%, compared to fossil-based production routes, when electricity from offshore wind turbines is used. At the same time, other environmental impacts like eutrophication and ozone depletion will increase. The main contributors to the environmental impacts are the energy supply for water electrolysis and direct air capture. Replacement of all plants for the production of the investigated products in Germany with CCU processes would lead to a 2–7% higher total primary energy demand for the whole country. At the same time, an overall reduction of the German GHG emissions by 6% is achieved, when using offshore wind power for these processes only. The future scenario using improved background technologies leads to a further small reduction of GHG emissions and largely reduces other environmental impacts. We therefore identify the reduction of emissions through improved base material production processes and recycling of aluminum, copper, steel and concrete as main objectives to reduce negative impacts for the production of basic chemicals from CCU technologies.\n",

      " \n",
      "In a growing number of regions around the world, solar and wind generated electricity is a large percentage of the overall supply.  In times of low demand and high renewable electricity production energy storage can be deployed to shift the environmentally preferred energy to times of the day/week/month when it is needed most.  Additionally, energy storage enables even higher penetrations of naturally varying renewable electricity sources to provide the increasing demand of the planet.  Historically, polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) electrolysis systems have been limited to small active areas, current density in the range of 1500 mA/cm2 and stack power levels in the 10's of kilowatts.  Today, PEM stack active area and current density are both increasing to enable smaller footprints than their alkaline counterparts.  Both of these changes are helping to decrease the cost of PEM electrolyzer systems. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) has shown that both PEM and alkaline electrolyzer systems can ramp power up and down very quickly to accommodate the needs of grids with high penetration of renewable electricity installed.  In addition, their ability to ramp quickly enables these electrolyzer systems to participate in grid ancillary services aimed at assuring a safe and reliability electrical grid.  The 99.99+% purity levels of the hydrogen product from these electrolyzer systems can be used in a number of industries including; fuel cell electric vehicle refueling, stored for use in stationary fuel cell applications, material handling refueling (e.g., forklifts) and can be reacted with carbon dioxide to produce renewable hydrocarbon chains (e.g., methane), which can then take advantage of existing infrastructure. In a project with DOE, NREL has designed, built and now operates a large active area stack test bed (STB) to support water electrolyzer industry partners.  The STB provides a flexible and open platform to allow the quick exchange and testing of stacks, sub-systems and components.  The goal of the modular system design is to provide industry a place to develop and validate hardware, process software and sub-system control algorithms to improve electrolyzer system efficiency, response, safety and capital costs.   The electrolyzer stack test bed was commissioned at NREL's Energy Systems Integration Facility (Golden, CO) in third quarter 2014 and then immediately provided factory acceptance testing of three 150 kW PEM electrolyzer stacks built by Giner, Inc. in November.  The STB is providing a testing platform for a novel hydrogen drying technique, developed at NREL, to reduce the amount of hydrogen product wasted when the stack is being powered with variable power.  In 2015 and 2016, research, development and demonstration work conducted with the STB will focus on improving system efficiency by optimizing balance of plant power requirements, power conversion optimization, grid integration and providing gas for hydrogen infrastructure component validation and 700 bar refueling demand.\n",

      "Objective  To evaluate the relationship between the hippocampal neuron-protective mechanism of hydrogen in a rat model of oxygen-glucose deprivation and restoration (OGD/R) and mitochondrial autophagy.   Methods  Hippocampal neurons isolated from healthy Sprague-Dawley rats (24 h after birth) were cultured in vitro , seeded in polylysine-coated 6-well plates at a density of 7×10 5 cells/well and then divided into 5 groups ( n =30 each) using a random number table method: control group (C group), OGD/R group, OGD/R+ H 2 group, OGD/R plus 3-methyladenine (3-MA) group (OGD/R+ 3-MA group), and OGD/R plus H 2 plus 3-MA group (OGD/R+ H 2 + 3-MA group). The cells were cultured for 24 h in normal culture atmosphere (75%N 2 -20%O 2 -5%CO 2 ) in group C, and cells were subjected to oxygen-glucose deprivation for 2 h followed by O 2 -glucose supply for 24 h to establish the model of OGD/R injury in OGD/R, OGD/R+ H 2 , OGD/R+ 3-MA and OGD/R+ H 2 + 3-MA groups.The cells were cultured for 24 h in a hydrogen-rich incubator (60% H 2 -10% O 2 -5% CO 2 -25% N 2 ) after establishing the model in group OGD/R+ H 2 .Autophagy inhibitor 3-MA 10 mmol/L was added, and then cultured for 24 h in normal culture atmosphere after establishing the model in group OGD/R+ 3-MA.Autophagy inhibitor 3-MA 10 mmol/L was added, and then cultured for 24 h in hydrogen-rich incubator after establishing the model in group OGD/R+ H 2 + 3-MA.The cell survival rate was measured using MTT assay.DCFH-DA fluorescent probe was applied for determination of reactive oxygen species (ROS) activity.The mitochondrial membrane potential was measured using a JC-10 assay kit.The neuronal apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry, and apoptosis rate was calculated.The expression of mitophagy-related protein microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3), PINK1 and Parkin was determined by Western blot, and LC3Ⅱ/LC3Ⅰ ratio was calculated.   Results  Compared with group C, the cell survival rate and MMP were significantly decreased, the apoptosis rate and ROS activity were increased, and the expression of PINK1 and Parkin and LC3Ⅱ/LC3Ⅰ ratio were increased in OGD/R and OGD/R+ H 2 groups ( P <0.05). Compared with group OGD/R, the cell survival rate and MMP were significantly increased, the apoptosis rate and ROS activity were decreased, and the expression of PINK1 and Parkin and LC3Ⅱ/LC3Ⅰ ratio were increased in group OGD/R+ H 2 ( P <0.05), and the cell survival rate and MMP were significantly decreased, the apoptosis rate and ROS activity were increased, and the expression of PINK1 and Parkin and LC3Ⅱ/LC3Ⅰ ratio were decreased in group OGD/R+ 3-MA ( P <0.05). Compared with group OGD/R+ H 2 , the cell survival rate and MMP were significantly decreased, the apoptosis rate and ROS activity were increased, and the expression of PINK1 and Parkin and LC3Ⅱ/LC3Ⅰ ratio were decreased in OGD/R+ 3-MA and OGD/R+ H 2 + 3-MA groups ( P <0.05).   Conclusion  Hippocampal neuron-protective mechanism of hydrogen against OGDR injury is related to promoting mitochondrial autophagy in rats.\n",

      "Aviation biofuels can help to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the United States, help to meet the Renewable Fuel Standard for cellulosic biofuels, and improve US energy security. Cellulosic biofuels carry a lot of risk, because conversion technology is expensive. As a result, incentives are needed to reduce the risk for private investors. Government can implement policies to reduce the risk in investment in aviation biofuels. The issue is deciding which policy will provide the most reduction in risk, while providing a lowest cost to the government. This analysis focuses on aviation biofuel production using fast pyrolysis from corn stover. Cost benefit analysis is used to calculate the net present value, internal rate of return, and benefit-cost ratio for a plant. Uncertainty is added to fuel price and four technical variables: capital cost, final fuel yield, hydrogen cost, and feedstock cost using @Risk, a Palisade Corporation software. We look at the impact of two policies: reverse auction and capital subsidy. For the reverse auction and capital subsidy, we used contract lengths of 5, 10, and 15 years to see the impact a longer contract could have on probability of loss. Both policies reduced risk in investment of aviation biofuels. A reverse auction reduced risk of investment more. As the contract length increased, the probability of loss and coefficient of variation in net present value were reduced substantially. When fuel price increased stochastically and a contract length of 15 years was used, probability of loss was reduced to 18.4%.\n",

To move fast, the transition must become more efficient and spread the best solutions far and wide. For difficult to decarbonise industries, collaboration is essential. The other essential ingredient is policy. The UK banned diesel and petrol car sales from 2030. This is driving electric vehicle manufacturing and supply chains. The EU banned single-use plastics from 2021. Consequently, Coca Cola Europe announced 100% of their bottles would be based on recycled plastic. Norway introduced a carbon tax in 1991 to encourage research into low-carbon solutions. It became the first country to geologically sequester CO2 and the first to do it from an LNG facility. Ten years after the tax was introduced, Norway’s carbon emissions had dropped by 14%. Policies influence emissions. They drive not only environmental outcomes but also sustainable growth and the ability to future-proof their economies. In 2007 and 2012, the UK announced funding for a commercial-scale carbon capture and storage project, both times the programs were aborted. A third attempt, this time focussing on decarbonising four industrial clusters by 2030, was announced in 2018 along with the first ‘net-zero’ carbon cluster by 2040, with the support of a number of UK policies it is expected to progress to construction.

      "Preferential labeling of the FPP-portion of chloroplastidic terpenoids incorporating isotopically labeled mevalonate were observed in cultured cells of liverworts and hornworts. Chloroplasts were isolated from cultured cells of liverworts, Heteroscyphus planus and incubated with ^3H-FPP to explain a reason for the non-equivalent labeling. ^3H-FPP was effectively taken into chloroplasts and converted to GGPP, while mevalonate was much poor precursor for the formation og GGPP. Thus uptake of FPP and its rapid conversion to GGPP is the reason for the non-equivalent labeling. It is also shown that a diverse source of supply (mevalonate pathway, 1-deoxy-D-xylulose pathway and reutilization of CO_2 from the carboxy carbon during acetate assimilation) is provided for the biosynthesis of the phytyl side-chain and carotenoids. A labeling pattern of striatol (3 in Fig.3) incorporating [2-^<13>C]- and [4,4-^2H_2]-mevalonate in cultured cells of Ptycanthus striatus indicated a proton addition to C-10 of the C10/C11 double bond and a concerted series of 1,2-migrations of hydrogen and methyl, followed by a specific elimination of a proton (not deuterium atom) at C-10 to form 3.

      "A computational investigation of the hydrated complexes of p-methoxyphenethylamine(H2O)2 - 4 (hereafter referred to as either MPEA(H2O)2 - 4 or simply 1:2−4) has been conducted at the B3LYP/6-31+G* level in order to find out the stable structures and the isomer binding energies (BEs). As expected, the calculations supply a large number of stable geometries, built up from one of the seven MPEA conformers and a chain of solvent molecules attached to a number of sites of the chromophore molecule. Within each complex stoichiometry, some isomers have very close binding energies, in fact, smaller than that of the basis set superposition error (BSSE). Despite the seven MPEA conformer precursors, the number of complex isomers recognized in two-color mass-resolved time-of-flight (TOF) and “hole burning” spectra are scarce: one for both 1:2 and 1:3 complexes, and two for the 1:4 complex. Notwithstanding the difficulty to identify the participant conformer within a specific complex, the computation shed light on a number of significant features of their structures, for example, that the first water molecule is always bound to the nitrogen atom of the NH2 group; in the 1:2 complex, the last arrived solvent attaches to the water already bound and to the hydrogen atom of the NH2 pointing away from the aromatic ring; the addition of the third solvent results in the formation of a water daisy chain around the NH2 moiety, and the addition of the fourth water gives rise to two structures of close stability. These results are interpreted as the systematic presence of two isomers for all 1:1−4 complexes but that their spectra overlap for 1:2 and 1:3 at the resolution of the experiments. The calculated energies for the addition of one water molecule at a time to the 1:n complex match fairly well the experimental measurements (within ∼200−300 cm-1, <1 kcal/mol).\n",

      "Time-temperature integrator/indicator (TTI) is a temperature monitoring tool that visually presents the temperature history of foods to easily and cost-effectively manage the temperature of food products in cold chain system. However, few TTIs exhibit suitable performance under chilled conditions over a long period, such as beyond 100 days, as in the storage and distribution of chilled beef across the world. This study aimed to visualize the temperature history of chilled vacuum-packed beef, during international distribution, using Maillard reaction–based TTIs to record the accumulated temperature under chilled conditions, for more than 100 days. The developed Maillard reaction–based TTI comprised of double-sealed large and small plastic pouches. While the small pouch contained 500 μL D-xylose solution, the large pouch contained 1000 μL glycine solution with disodium hydrogen phosphate solution. Both the solutions were mixed by breaking the small pouch into the large pouch, following which the Maillard reaction started, depending on the ambient temperature. We examined two different combinations of the solution concentrations of TTI that turned brown and yellow at − 0.5 °C after approximately 77 days and 100 days, respectively. The developed TTIs, along with Tasmanian chilled beef, were transported from Australia to Japan through commercial supply chains and stored at a constant temperature of − 0.5 °C. One of the TTIs (TTI-brown) turned pale brown after 77 days which is the current shelf life of Australian chilled beef in Japan. The color of TTI-yellow changed to clear yellow after 150 days, when the chilled beef developed an off-odor, as judged by sensory evaluation. The TTI-brown was functional until day 77 which is the current shelf life of Australian beef in Japan, while the TTI-yellow was functional until day 150 to indicate remaining shelf life of beef. The results collectively indicated the Maillard reaction–based TTIs to realize visualization of temperature history during long-term storage and distribution of chilled beef.\n",

To move fast, the transition must become more efficient and spread the best solutions far and wide. For difficult to decarbonise industries, collaboration is essential. The other essential ingredient is policy. The UK banned diesel and petrol car sales from 2030. This is driving electric vehicle manufacturing and supply chains. The EU banned single-use plastics from 2021. Consequently, Coca Cola Europe announced 100% of their bottles would be based on recycled plastic. Norway introduced a carbon tax in 1991 to encourage research into low-carbon solutions. It became the first country to geologically sequester CO2 and the first to do it from an LNG facility. Ten years after the tax was introduced, Norway’s carbon emissions had dropped by 14%. Policies influence emissions. They drive not only environmental outcomes but also sustainable growth and the ability to future-proof their economies. In 2007 and 2012, the UK announced funding for a commercial-scale carbon capture and storage project, both times the programs were aborted. A third attempt, this time focussing on decarbonising four industrial clusters by 2030, was announced in 2018 along with the first ‘net-zero’ carbon cluster by 2040, with the support of a number of UK policies it is expected to progress to construction. This paper discusses the journey from policy through partnerships to the development of Carbon Capture and Hydrogen Clusters in the UK and looks at lessons learnt for Australia.

      "To clarify the reaction characteristics of electropolishing of SUS304 in phosphoric acid electrolyte, the polishing amount was determined by changing the voltage. Effects of varying the water content in the electrolyte were also clarified. Furthermore, we measured the oxygen gas on the anode side and hydrogen gas on the cathode side generated by the water splitting reaction that occurred in parallel with the electropolishing reaction. Using Ion Chromatography with Mass Spectrometry, we then analyzed the electrolyte chemical compositions before and after electropolishing. Results of these investigations demonstrate that the electropolishing amount increased as the voltage increased, but the electropolishing amount at each voltage decreased considerably as the water content decreased from 15% to 9.8% and 6.4%. Results show that, during electropolishing, the dimer and tetramer formation reaction of phosphoric acid proceeded in the electrolyte. This tendency is more pronounced when the water content is low. On the other hand, the amount of gas generated on the anode and cathode sides during electropolishing did not change with the change in water content. These phenomena can be explained by the water supply chain as follows. During electropolishing, the water splitting reaction proceeds at a steady rate and localized water shortage occurs on the electrode surface. To compensate for this water shortage, the lower the water content in the electrolyte, the more the phosphoric acid condensation reaction, a water-generating reaction, proceeds in preference to the phosphoric acid anionization reaction. As a result, the elution reaction of metals, the counter-reaction of the phosphoric acid anionization reaction, is suppressed in electrolytes with low water content.\n",

The second part is devoted to the peculiarities of economic cooperation during this period. The economy has come under the influence of restrictions on labor and capital mobility caused by the pandemic, disruptions in global supply chains, as well as negative dynamics of global commodity prices. Together, they led to a significant decrease in mutual trade. Negative processes took place against the background of a deep crisis of political confidence, the introduction of new sanctions by the EU and the US and the extension of existing sanctions. Efforts have increased to create a negative image of Russia in Germany. However, the business community of both countries managed to counter negative trends with steps aimed at stabilizing bilateral cooperation and giving it progressive development. Companies of both countries, despite negative events, did not stop their investment activity. A new area of cooperation has emerged – hydrogen energy, which should become one of the foundations for the energy transition of the EU countries to a climate-neutral economy. Interdepartmental state cooperation in the economic sphere continued. In September 2020, the results of the three-year German-Russian scientific and educational partnership were summed up. At the same time, the Year of Germany began in Russia, and in December, the common German-Russian Year of Economy and Sustainable Development. The article analyzes the features of economic cooperation, highlights the main factors that determine its content and gives a forecast of its mid-term development.

      "The determination of a water mist additive is important to weaken the flame enhanced by water mist, which affects the safety and applicability of the water mist fire-fighting technology to a certain extent. Based on the theory of physical chemistry, in this study, a water mist additive, that is, a nonionic liquid alkyl phenol epoxide (APE) condensate to weaken the flame intensification and systematically perform an experimental study on extinguishing the fire in oil pool with nonionic liquid water mist. The results show that the nonionic liquid water mist has better atomization parameters. The extinguishing time and the maximum temperature are all decreased with the increase of nonionic liquid mass fraction under the action of nonionic liquid water mist. The maximum CO volume fraction and the time to maintain a high CO volume fraction in fire flue gas decreases with the increasing nonionic liquid mass fraction. The minimum O2 volume fraction and the recovery rate from this minimum value to the normal value increases with increasing nonionic liquid mass fraction. The nonionic liquid water mist can weaken the flame intensification and extinguish the oil pool fire better than pure water mist. This is because the suspended air and water bubbles formed after the spraying of the nonionic liquid water mist can block heat radiation, cutting off the oxygen supply and isolating the contact of combustibles with oxygen. In addition, owing to high temperature, surfactant and water molecules linked by hydrogen bond ether group rupture, resulting in reduced HLB, thus enhancing the ability to trap hydrocarbon molecules and capture H• and OH• radicals in the chain reaction.\n",

      "10.1002/adfm.202104071\n",
      " \n",
      "Aqueous thermocells that are eco‐friendly and capable of converting low‐grade heat into electricity continuously are promising candidates to power flexible and wearable devices in various application scenarios. However, challenges remain in their limited working temperatures, mechanical fragility, and poor thermoelectric performance, mainly due to the reduced entropy of both polymer chains and thermogalvanic ions at low temperatures. In this work, the challenges are addressed by introducing a synergistic chaotropic effect to destruct strong hydrogen bonds, increase polymers’ entropic elasticity, and enlarge the entropy difference of thermogalvanic ions. An organohydrogel thermocell is designed with a chaotropic comonomer and a chaotropic cosolvent. The maximum normalized power density of the thermocell achieves 0.1 mW m−2 K−2, which is in the same order of magnitude as the highest record in current quasi‐solid thermocells. Even at −30 °C, the thermocell maintains the elongation at a break of more than 100% and a relatively high power density of 0.012 mW m−2 K−2. Furthermore, the thermocell shows the potential to light up a light‐emitting diode and stably works when compressed, bent, and stretched in a wide temperature range. This work provides insights on developing reliable power sources to drive flexible electronics continually in extremely cold environments. A stretchable, freeze‐tolerant, and high‐efficiency thermocell is designed based on a synergistic chaotropic effect. The thermocell is anti‐freezing even at −50 °C, and the maximum normalized power density is comparable to the highest record in current quasi‐solid thermocells. This work opens an avenue for developing stretchable power supplies working continuously in extremely cold environments.\n",

      "Huge and ever-increasing energy consumption and consequent greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions pose unprecedented challenges to the sustainable development of the international human society. Our existing energy systems, where primary energy is converted to all sorts of final energy services, remain the major contributor to these global energy and environmental challenges. It is becoming a consensus that the conventional energy conversion and utilization mode should make place for a more sustainable one with higher energy conversion efficiency, lower air pollutions and GHG emissions, less dependence on fossil fuels, and more utilization of renewable energy. However, although there exist many technical options and technology pathways to enable this transition, they are usually treated separately by their very own technical communities and political groups without coordination with others, and the overall effect and potential is therefore greatly constrained as compared to a systematic approach where all alternatives are taken into consideration in an integrated way. Energy systems engineering provides a methodological modeling and optimization framework to address the complex energy and environmental problems existed in design and operation of energy systems in an integrated manner. This methodological framework is generic, and it can help to produce optimal design and operational plans for energy systems ranging from nanoscale, microscale, mesoscale, to mega-scale levels over operating horizons from milliseconds to months and years. This Article first gives a brief overview of typical methodologies of energy systems engineering, comprising superstructure based modeling, mixed-integer linear and nonlinear programming, multiobjective optimization, optimization under uncertainty, and life-cycle assessment. The concept of energy systems engineering and these methodologies are further illustrated via their applications in some typical real-life energy systems of very different nature and scale, ranging from polygeneration energy systems, hydrogen infrastructure planning, energy systems in commercial buildings, and biofuel supply chains.\n",

      " \n",
      "Policies to develop and deploy CCS as a tool for climate change mitigation should consider the key differences between three classes of CCS projects: carbon-positive, near carbon-neutral and potentially carbon-negative. In class 1 are projects that are ‘carbon positive’ since they capture CO2 from the production of fossil hydrocarbon fuels and there is no guarantee that the CO2 generated when these are used will be captured and stored. Class 1 CCS might be treated as a condition of the ‘licence to operate’ for hydrocarbon production projects that emit large amounts of CO2, and be distinguished from other classes of CCS projects in any incentive framework. In the event of serious global action on climate change, it seems likely that class 1 CCS would be employed to minimise fossil fuel supply chain CO2 emissions, but in addition all fossil fuels would need to be used with class 2, near carbon neutral, CCS, so that the vast majority of fossil carbon is captured and stored and the main products are decarbonised energy vectors such as electricity, hydrogen and heat. Class 2 CCS projects are generally more expensive than class 1 projects and require more novel technologies, so they are unlikely to be widely deployed at present without specific incentives, an analogous situation to that for many renewable generation technologies. Carbon negative class 3 projects, where biomass use and CCS are combined, or where CO2 is captured directly from the air, could also be important since they have the potential to achieve a net reduction in atmospheric CO2 concentrations, as well as to offset residual emissions from other classes of CCS.\n",

      " \n",
      "Supply chains for transportation fuels were analyzed using an extensive system boundary to gain insights into the connections between transportation energy and water resource consumption. The sustainability of energy resources such as transportation fuels is increasingly connected to the consumption of water resources. Water is required for irrigation in the development of bioenergy, reservoir creation in hydroelectric power generation, drilling and resource displacement in petroleum and gas production, mineral extraction in mining operations, and cooling and processing in thermoelectric power generation. Vehicles powered by petroleum, electricity, natural gas, ethanol, biodiesel, and hydrogen fuel cells consume water resources indirectly through fuel production cycles, and it is important to understand the impacts of these technologies on water resources. Previous investigations of water consumption for transportation fuels have focused primarily on key processes and pathways, ignoring the impacts of many intermediate, inter-related processes used in fuel production cycles. Herein, the results of a life cycle analysis of water consumption for transportation fuels in the United States using an extensive system boundary that includes the water embedded in intermediate processing and transportation fuels are presented. The Greenhouse Gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy Use in Transportation (GREET) model provides a comprehensive framework and system boundary for transportation fuel analysis in the United States. GREET was expanded to include water consumption and used to compare the water consumed per unit energy and per km traveled in light-duty vehicles. Many alternative fuels were found to consume larger quantities of water on a per km basis than traditional petroleum pathways, and it is therefore important to consider the implications of transportation and energy policy changes on water resources in the future.\n",

      " \n",
      "Current Greenhous gas emissions (GHG) from maritime transport represent around 3% of global anthropogenic GHG emissions and will have to be cut in half by 2050 to meet Paris agreement goals. Liquefied natural gas (LNG) is by many seen as a potential transition fuel for decarbonizing shipping. Its favorable hydrogen to carbon ratio compared to diesel (marine gas oil, MGO) or bunker fuel (heavy fuel oil, HFO) translates directly into lower carbon emissions per kilowatt produced. However, these gains may be nullified once one includes the higher Well-to-tank emissions (WTT) of the LNG supply chain and the vessel’s un-combusted methane slip (CH4) from its combustion engine. Previous studies have tended to focus either on greenhouse gas emissions from LNG in a Well-to-wake (WTW) perspective, or on alternative engine technologies and their impact on the vessel’s Tank-to-wake emissions (TTW). This study investigates under what conditions LNG can serve as a transition fuel in the decarbonization of maritime transport, while ensuring the lowest possible additional global warming impact. Transition refers to the process of moving away from fossil fuels towards new and low carbon fuels and engine technologies. Our results show: First, the importance of applying appropriate engine technologies to maximize GHG reductions; Second, that applying best engine technologies is not economically profitable; Third, how regulations could be amended to reward best engine technologies. Importantly, while the GHG reduction of LNG even with best engine technology (dual fuel diesel engine) are limited, ships with these engines can with economically modest modification switch to ammonia produced with renewable energy when it becomes available in sufficient amounts.\n",

      "Field emission based microplasma actuators generate highly non-neutral surface discharges that can be used to heat, pump, and mix the flow through microchannels and offer an innovative solution to the problems associated with microcombustion. They provide a constant source of heat to counter the large heat loss through the combustor surface, they aid in flow transport at low Reynolds numbers without the use of moving parts, and they provide a constant supply of radicals to promote chain branching reactions. In this work, we present two actuator concepts for the generation of field emission microplasma, one with offset electrodes and the other with planar electrodes. They operate at input voltages in the 275–325 V range at a frequency of 1 GHz which is found to be the most suitable value for flow enhancement. The momentum and energy imparted by the charged particles to the neutrals as modeled by 2D particle-in-cell with Monte Carlo collisions are applied to actuate flow in microchannels using 2D computational fluid dynamics modeling. The planar electrode configuration is found to be more suitable for the purpose of heating, igniting and mixing the flow, as well as improving its residence time through a 10 mm long microcombustor. The combustion of hydrogen and air with the help of 4 such actuators, each with a power consumption of 47.5 mW cm−1, generates power with an efficiency of 90.5%. Such microcombustors can be applied to all battery based systems requiring micropower generation with the the ultimate goal of 'generating power on a chip'.\n",

      " \n",
      "Campylobacter are the primary cause of food poisoning in the UK and many other countries so, because chicken are recognised as one of the main routes by which this organism gets into the human food chain, there is considerable interest in identifying potential sources of Campylobacter on the farm. One potential source of infection is water, which may also be a means by which the organism is transmitted through the flock following initial infection. Studies into the role of water in Campylobacter infection of chickens have identified the importance of factors such as biofilm in protecting the organisms and, potentially, the viable but non-culturable form (VNC) of Campylobacter. While difficulties in identifying the VNC form in field outbreaks may have led to an underestimate of the importance of water as a risk factor there are contradictory views regarding the ability of the VNC form to cause infection under field conditions. Producers may treat drinking water with a range of products to reduce the number of microbial contaminants, Campylobacter included, that reach the growing bird in the drinking water. Examples of products used by producers include chlorine, chlorine dioxide, organic acids, peracetic acid and hydrogen peroxide. The efficacy of these products differs depending on the environment in which they are used, pH for example having a significant effect on the efficacy of chlorine. If the full benefits of drinking water treatment are to be realised then further evidence is required, in terms of the effects on the normal production parameters such as weight gain, feed conversion efficiency, flock uniformity as well as on the prevalence of infection such as that caused by Campylobacter.\n",

      "With the rapid depletion of fossil reserves, unstable prices of fossil commodities and the negative effect of fossil fuel on the environment, the demand for clean energy power generation increases. Proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells are a prominent technology for power generation in a variety of applications such as fuel cell vehicles, portable power supplies, stationary power stations and submarines. With their high power density, low emission, low operating temperature, high efficiency, noiseless operation and simplicity of design and operation, PEM fuel cells have a number of attractive advantages over traditional power sources. In this paper, the degradation mechanism of the catalyst layer of the membrane electrode assembly and the core component of the proton exchange membrane fuel cell are summarized. Besides, the degradation mechanism of the Pt-based catalyst, carbon support and Nafion ionomer are obtained. Considering the agglomeration and growth of Pt catalyst, Pt loss and migration, active site pollution and other micro processes, the degradation of catalyst is analyzed in depth. Furthermore, the carbon corrosion process is studied under the normal operation, fuel starvation of the anode and partial hydrogen coverage of the anode processes. In addition, the chemical degradation of Nafion ionomer and the effect of the length of the side chain to the electrode structure are discussed. Eventually, the improved strategies for the failure of the catalyst layer of the membrane electrode assembly are proposed, in the hope to provide useful guidance for the development of long-life proton exchange membrane fuel cells in commercialization.\n",

      " \n",
      "Solution-cast films of sulfonated block copolymers are investigated for applications in water purification, gas separations, and fuel cells. It is well known that solvent composition influences the structures that form in solutions of sulfonated block copolymers and in the corresponding films. The solutions often contain trace water due to the hygroscopic nature of sulfonated polymers, and the effect of trace water on structure formation has not been previously explored. Water will drive dissociation of sulfonic acid, which in turn might accelerate the rearrangement of polymer chains by disrupting hydrogen bonds between acid groups. In this work, we examine the effects of trace water on the solution-state structure of a sulfonated pentablock copolymer (SPC) and the ultimate film morphology using small-angle X-ray scattering. The solvent used was a mixture of toluene and n-propanol with varying molar ratios of water to sulfonic acid (λ). In solutions with λ = 0, the SPC adopts a disordered structure. The addition of trace water (λ = 3.2) to SPC solutions drives a rapid self-assembly into an ordered lamellar structure. However, the presence of trace water in the solution has little effect on processing the SPC into films as water will rapidly escape from the drying film in a dry environment. For film processing, ambient humidity is more important than trace water in the solution as moisture in air provides a constant supply of water to the film as the solvent evaporates. While there are many variables that control the morphology of solution-cast SPC films, these studies demonstrate that trace amounts of water play a critical role in kinetics and thermodynamics of solution-state self-assembly and the evolution of nanoscale structures during film drying.\n",

      "10.3390/en6115642\n",
      " \n",
      "With the increasing demand for renewable energy and sustainable waste treatment, biogas production is expanding. Approximately four billion litres of bio-ethanol are produced annually for vehicle fuel in Europe, resulting in the production of large amounts of stillage residues. This stillage is energy-rich and can be used for biogas production, but is a challenging substrate due to its high levels of nitrogen and sulphate. At the full-scale biogas production plant in Norrköping, Sweden (Svensk Biogas i Linköping AB), thin grain stillage is used as a biogas substrate. This paper describes the plant operation and strategies that have been implemented to digest thin stillage successfully. High ammonia concentrations in the digester have resulted in syntrophic acetate oxidation (SAO) becoming the major pathway for acetate degradation. Therefore, a long hydraulic retention time (HRT) (40–60 days) is used to allow the syntrophic acetate-oxidising bacteria time to grow. The high sulphate levels in thin stillage result in high levels of hydrogen sulphide following degradation of protein and the activity of sulphate-reducing bacteria (SRB), the presence of which has been confirmed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis. To optimise biogas production and maintain a stable process, the substrate is diluted with tap water and co-digested with grain residues and glycerine to keep the ammonium nitrogen (NH4-N) concentration below 6 g L−1. Combined addition of iron, hydrochloric acid and cobalt successfully precipitates sulphides, reduces ammonia toxicity and supplies microorganisms with trace element. Mesophilic temperature (38 °C) is employed to further avoid ammonia toxicity. Together, these measures and doubling the digester volume have made it possible to increase annual biogas production from 27.7 TJ to 69.1 TJ.\n",

      " \n",
      "Due to the rapid increase in environmental and energy issues, it is required to replace fossil fuel-driven conventional internal combustion engines with an energy conversion system using sustainable fuels. Although fuel cell is one of the possible candidates due to its high efficiency, the storage and transportation of hydrogen fuel hinder its widespread use. 1 To overcome this problem, hydrogen careers, hydrogen-rich liquid and solid-phase materials, have been proposed as alternative fuels for fuel cell systems. Among the hydrogen carriers, methanol is one of the promising candidates due to its low production cost and high energy density. However, the slow kinetics of the methanol oxidation reaction (MOR), which proceeds via a complex six-electron pathway, limits the overall efficiency of the direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC). 2 Much effort has been put into improving the MOR activity, including the development of electrocatalyst by metal alloying and surface modification of the electrocatalyst by thiol derivatives. 3   Here, we focused on using sulfur-organic compound copolymer synthesized from S 8 and organic molecules as a surface modifier. We then explored the reaction mechanisms on Pt surface in the alkaline environment by tracking the surface-bound intermediates using in situ surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (SEIRAS). We selected styrene as an organic component and synthesized sulfur-organic compound copolymer (poly(s-st)). Synthesized poly(s-st) was decorated on the Pt surface by simply immersing the electrode into the poly(s-st)-contained solution. Cyclic voltammogram and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirm the surface modification of the Pt surface by poly(s-st), which was stable after 5 cycles of potential cycling in 0.1 M KOH electrolyte. The oxidation current at 0.78 V vs. RHE, which is related to the MOR, was more significant than the pristine Pt electrode, which confirms the improvement of the MOR activity by poly(s-st) modification. The degree of activity enhancement became more substantial with the increase in alkyl chain length of alcohol fuels (methanol < propanol < 1-butanol), suggesting the reason of the enhanced activity to be the hydrophobic interaction between phenyl group of a surface modifier and alkyl portion of alcohol fuels which could facilitate the fuel supply on Pt electrode. In order to support our hypothesis, we performed SEIRAS measurement, where we observed a peak corresponds to the site-blocking species at ca. 1500 cm -1 for pristine Pt surface, while no corresponding peak was observed for poly(s-st) modified Pt surface. We will discuss the changes in the surface reaction mechanism based on the direct observation of the reaction intermediates by SEIRAS. It will also be demonstrated that the holistic information about the nature of the adsorbed species can provide a strategy to design the surface modifier to tune the energetics of key reaction intermediates, leading to further improvements in electrocatalytic activity for the methanol oxidation reaction.

      "Biological methanation (biomethanation) of syngas obtained from biomass gasification offers the opportunity to employ a low-pressure, low-temperature process to produce storable bio-derived substitute natural gas (bSNG), although its economic viability is limited by high energy and biomass costs. Research on syngas biomethanation techno-economic performance is limited and novel biomass-to-biomethane process configurations are required in order to assess opportunities for the enhancement of its efficiency and economic feasibility. In this study, we carried out the techno-economic modeling of two processes comprising integrated biomass gasification, electrolysis, and syngas biomethanation with combined heat and power recovery in order to assess and compare their fuel yields, energy efficiency, carbon efficiency, and bSNG minimum selling price (MSP). The first process operates standalone biomethanation (SAB) of syngas and can produce approximately 38,000 Nm3 of bSNG per day, with a total plant efficiency of 50.6%. The second process (integrated biomethane-biomethanol, IBB) exploits the unconverted carbon stream from the biomethanation process to recover energy and synthesize methanol via direct catalytic CO2 hydrogenation. In addition to the same bSNG output, the IBB process can produce 10 t/day of biomethanol, at a 99% purity. The IBB process shows little global energy efficiency gains in comparison with SAB (51.7%) due to the large increase in electrolytic hydrogen demand, but it shows a substantial improvement in biomass-to-fuel carbon efficiency (33 vs. 26%). The SAB and IBB processes generate a bSNG MSP of 2.38 €/Nm3 and 3.68 €/Nm3, respectively. Hydrogenation of unconverted carbon in biomass-to-biomethane processes comes with high additional capital and operating costs due to the large-scale electrolysis plants required. Consequently, in both processes, the market price gap of the bSNG produced is 0.13 €/kWhbSNG (SAB) and 0.25 €/kWhbSNG (IBB) even under the most optimistic cost scenarios considered, and it is primarily influenced by the cost of surplus electricity utilized in electrolysis, while the selling price of biomethanol exerts a very limited influence on process economics. Intensive subsidization would be required in order to sustain the decentralized production of bSNG through both processes. Despite their limited economic competitiveness, both processes have a size comparable with existing renewable gas production plants in terms of bSNG production capacity and the IBB process is of a size adequate for the supply of biomethanol to a decentralized biorenewable supply chain.\n",

      "Hydrogen systems are gaining importance in view of a progressive decarbonisation of societies, and becoming more and more cost-competitive alternatives in many sectors (e.g., mobility). However, the sustainability of these technologies must be carefully assessed following a holistic approach which embraces not only environmental but also social aspects. Social Life Cycle Assessment (S-LCA) is an insightful methodology to evaluate potential social impacts of products along their life cycle. In the frame of the project eGHOST, social risks of a proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) stack were assessed through an S-LCA. The functional unit was defined as one 48 kW stack (balance of plant excluded), targeted for mobility applications. The supply chain was defined assuming Spain as the manufacturing country and involving from the material/energy production plants to the stack manufacturing. Beyond conventional life cycle inventory data, trade information and additional inventory data were retrieved from the UN Comtrade and PSILCA databases, respectively. Besides, working hours for the manufacturing plants of the stack and its subcomponents were calculated based on literature data. Social life cycle inventories were modelled and evaluated using openLCA and the PSILCA method. Two stakeholder categories, workers and society, were considered through the following social indicators: child labour, contribution to economic development, fair salary, forced labour, gender wage gap, and health expenditure. The choice of these indicators is in line with the eGHOST project purpose. Despite the relatively small amount contained in the product, platinum clearly arose as the main social hotspot under each of the selected indicators. At the level of component plants, the manufacturing of bipolar and end plates was also found to be relevant under some indicators. On the other hand, electricity consumption generally accounted for a minor contribution. Overall, in order to avoid burden shifting from environmental to social issues, a careful design of technologies is needed.\n",

      " \n",
      "This paper presents two different approaches to deal with uncertainties in the design optimization of renewable hybrid power systems in order to enhance the decision-making. The first one, Sensitivity Analysis Approach (denoted as SAA), takes the uncertainties into account after the optimization of the system. It permits first to evaluate the sensitivity on the static performances of the optimized system through uncertainty propagation. Secondly, it permits to identify the most influential uncertain parameters through Global Sensitivity Analysis (denoted as GSA). The second approach, called Robust Optimization (RO), integrates a Monte Carlo (MC) simulation into the process of optimization conducted with a Genetic Algorithm (GA). The two approaches have been set up and applied to a remote power system or microgrid, under uncertainties on techno-economic parameters. This illustrative case study is the electrical supply of a stand-alone application located in Nigeria, using photovoltaic production associated to a hybrid energy storage with a bank of batteries and a complete hydrogen chain (with an electrolyzer, a gas tank and a Fuel Cell (FC). Classically, the main source of uncertainties of such a system is associated to the temporal variation of renewable energy sources and load demands. Instead, this paper focuses on uncertainties of techno-economic parameters to improve the reliability of the optimization process for a stand-alone power system. Moreover, from a precise analysis of the state-of-the-art of such uncertainties, the authors propose to investigate complementarities of Sensitivity Analysis Approach and Robust Optimization. This study also aims to propose a methodological framework for any designer projecting to take into account uncertainties on techno-economic parameters. The results show the high interest to take into account such uncertainties for the decision-making and the ability of RO to limit their impact on system performance indicators.\n",

      " \n",
      "Globally, more than one billion cubic meters of waste etchants from printed circuit board industry have been generated annually with an increase of 15-18%. Nowadays, the approach of adding extra chemicals has been utilized to treat a large number of waste etchants, which could obtain low-pure products, but seriously pollute the environment. Furthermore, the processing enterprise cannot gain so much value that is affecting sustainable development. In the previous studies, the regeneration technologies of etching solution have not been studied comprehensively and systematically, so it is of extreme necessity to examine and choose the suitable technology towards a closed-loop supply chain. The results showed that previous etching solution (e.g. ammonium persulfate, sulfur/chromic acid, sulfuric acid/hydrogen peroxide, sodium chloride, ferric chloride) caused severe pollution without proper disposal, but most of the current etchants (e.g. cupric chloride, alkaline etching solution) can be renewable after substantially recycling heavy metals from the etchants. Regarding the latest emerging solution, the used oxidant such as chlorine is regarded as the major risk sources even if it has extraordinary etching ability. The current etching solutions could meet the goal of sustainable development of resources and the environment. For the copper chloride etching solutions that are now widely applied, there are various regeneration approaches, but only two are more favorable than the others. Among all the regeneration technologies, the electrolytic process and membrane technology not only get more pure products, but the residue solution can be renewable. Finally, we employed the analytic hierarchy process to compare the regeneration techniques and found that the electrolytic method and membrane technology are superior to other methods in the economic and environmental performance. The two methods can replace the chemical precipitation, which will sustain the printed circuit board industry.\n",

      " \n",
      "The results of the studies of mechanochemical activation of motor fuels aimed to increase their calorific value and reduce their consumption in automotive internal combustion engines are summarized. Traditionally, the improvement in fuel efficiency and environmental friendliness of such engines is achieved by high-tech modernization of fuel systems. But it can also be achieved by modification of fuels that changes their properties and increases the calorific value. By means of methods of mechanochemistry, using the equipment with low power consumption and a simple process, the mixtures and separate oil fractions are destroyed with the formation of low molecular homologs, as well as hydrogen and carbon. The degradation of saturated hydrocarbons is the breaking of chains, and unsaturated ones are destroyed through the formation of saturated products. The hydrogenation by degradation products of the starting material is possible. The mechanochemistry of fuels is investigated on the example of a combined static mixer-activator. The activator in the form of cylinder of 150 mm length and 30-50 mm diameter is used for modifying motor fuels; it has three serial camera, embeds in any of the fuel systems of internal combustion engine, does not require the drive, is free of chemical substances, does not affect the performance of gasoline, diesel fuel, aviation kerosene, fuel oil, does not reduce the engine lifetime. The tests were performed on a test bench with YaMZ-236 diesel engine using three different diesel fuels, at first with installation of activator in the fuel supply line of fuel high pressure pump, and then in its main drain line. When idling of diesel engine with engine speed of 900-1300 rpm, the reduction of activated fuel consumption on average by 26.3% is revealed in eleven tests. The methods for improving the calorific value of fuels by different impacts are reviewed.\n",

      " \n",
      "Electricity-based mobility (EBM) refers to vehicles that use electricity as their primary energy source either directly such as Battery Electric Vehicles (BEV) or indirectly such as hydrogen (H2) driven Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles (FCEV) or Synthetic Natural Gas Vehicles (SNG-V). If low-carbon electricity is used, EBM has the potential to be more sustainable than conventional fossil-fuel based vehicles. While BEV feature the highest tank-to-wheel efficiency, electricity can only be stored for short durations in the energy system (e.g. via pumped-hydro storage or batteries), whereas H2-FCEV and SNG-V have a lower tank-to-wheel efficiency due to additional conversion losses, H2 and SNG can be stored longer in pressurized tanks or the natural gas grid. Thus, they feature more flexibility with regard to exploiting renewable electricity via seasonal storage. In this study, we examine whether and under what circumstances this additional flexibility of H2 and SNG can be used to offset additional losses in the powertrain and conversion with respect to greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation of EBM from a life-cycle point of view in a Swiss scenario setting. To this end, a supply chain model for EBM fuels is established in the context of an evolving Swiss and European electricity system along with an approach to estimate the penetration of EBM in a legislation compliant future passenger cars fleet. We show that EBM results in significantly lower life-cycle GHG emissions than a corresponding fossil fuels driven fleet. BEV generally entail the lowest GHG emissions if flexibility options can be offered through sector coupling, short-term and seasonal energy storage or demand side management. Otherwise, in particular with a large expansion of photovoltaics (PV) and curtailment of excess electricity, H2-FCEV and SNG-V feature equal or – in case of high-carbon electricity imports – even lower GHG emissions than BEV.\n",

      "10.1088/1748-9326/aa67a5\n",
      " \n",
      "Current ambitions to limit climate change to no more than 1.5 °C–2 °C by the end of the 21st century rely heavily on the availability of negative emissions technologies (NETs)—bioenergy with CO2 capture and storage (BECCS) and direct air capture in particular. In this context, these NETs are providing a specific service by removing CO2 from the atmosphere, and therefore investors would expect an appropriate risk-adjusted rate of return, varying as a function of the quantity of public money involved. Uniquely, BECCS facilities have the possibility to generate both low carbon power and remove CO2 from the atmosphere, but in an energy system characterised by high penetration of intermittent renewable energy such as wind and solar power plants, the dispatch load factor of such BECCS facilities may be small relative to their capacity. This has the potential to significantly under utilise these assets for their primary purpose of removing CO2 from the atmosphere. In this study, we present a techno-economic environmental evaluation of BECCS plants with a range of operating efficiencies, considering their full- and part-load operation relative to a national-scale annual CO2 removal target. We find that in all cases, a lower capital cost, lower efficiency BECCS plant is superior to a higher cost, higher efficiency facility from both environmental and economic perspectives. We show that it may be preferable to operate the BECCS facility in base-load fashion, constantly removing CO2 from the atmosphere and dispatching electricity on an as-needed basis. We show that the use of this 'spare capacity' to produce hydrogen for, e.g. injection to a natural gas system for the provision of low carbon heating can add to the overall environmental and economic benefit of such a system. The only point where this hypothesis appears to break down is where the CO2 emissions associated with the biomass supply chain are sufficiently large so as to eliminate the service of CO2 removal.\n",

      " \n",
      "The Taskomirsay section (South Kazakhstan) is a unique Pliensbachian-Toarcian sequence of lignites, clayey layers and silty-sandstones deposited in a fluvial/lacustrine environment with nearby swampy areas. This period, characterized by a drastic climate change, has been particularly studied in Western Tethyan marine environments, whereas very few studies focused on continental settings. Paleoflora analyses, associated with a multi-isotope approach, based on well-preserved Type-III bulk organic nitrogen isotopes (δ 15Norg) and hydrogen isotopic composition (δ 2H) of n-alkanes, were developed to document paleoclimatic changes in the area. Sporomorph associations and fossil woods revealed a globally warm- to cool-temperate climate – characterized by Xenoxylon, a conifer morphogenus biogeographically related to cool/humid settings – apart from slightly less humid and warmer conditions in the early Toarcian. Warmer conditions are supported by reconstructed Mean Annual Air Temperatures (MAATs), based on the first branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (brGDGTs) ever recorded in the Early Jurassic. Nevertheless, no drastic changes were recorded in the δ 15Norg values; its signal being attributed to tenuous equilibrium between water- and nutrient-availability via intense N-recycling. Based on n-alkane distributions, sources of organic matter were separated in two pools: (i) a purely terrestrial (n-C27) and (ii) an “aquatic” pool (n-C23) constituted of vegetation that thrived under almost permanent water supply. The n-alkane δ 2H values (−248 to −151‰) as well as their amounts and average chain lengths (ACL) are in agreement with cool-temperate conditions in the Pliensbachian and less humid/warmer conditions in the early Toarcian. The isotopic difference between δ 2H values of n-C27 and n-C23 (Δ2Hter-aq) suggests enhanced seasonality during the Pliensbachian-Toarcian transition and low seasonality in the early Toarcian, in agreement with temperate climate-regime. Finally, contrasted response to paleoclimate changes between markers suggests different spatial integration of those proxies. The role of sea-level variations for δ 2H values might also resolve this contrasted response.\n",

      "OPTIMAL IN THE NATIONAL ENERGY SECTOR DIRECTIONS OF FORMATION OF INFRASTRUCTURE COMPLEX\n",
      "10.36962/pahtei13022022-80\n",
      " \n",
      "The article deals with the relevance of more effective structural transformation through the introduction of new innovations using advanced world experience in the infrastructure complex of the energy sector of the Republic of Azerbaijan. In this regard, the study also reflects the analysis and research on the directions of formation of optimal infrastructure complex in the energy sector. For this purpose, new development targets have been identified in the first chain of the national energy sector infrastructure complex against the background of progressive world experience analysis. For this purpose, the experience of leading world countries in oil and gas industry, including the United States of America, people's Republic of China, Russian Federation, Great Britain, Japan, South African Republic, Norway and others has been studied. The learning spectrum also covered the experience of well-known transnational corporations, including “Statoil”, “Schlumberger”, “Rosneft”, “Gazprom”, “Lukoil” and others. The existing positive trends in this sphere were based on systematized for application in the first chain of infrastructure complex of the national energy sector. Based on this, based on the analysis, the following were identified as the directions of formation of optimal infrastructure complex in the first chain of the national energy sector: • creation of a broad spectrum of continuously renewing energy potential; • increasing efficiency of production and processing of oil, gas and other energy resources and strengthening innovative supply of their production; • technological renewal of the fuel and energy complex and transition to energy-efficient strategic development model in this sphere in order to meet the growing domestic demand of the economy and ensure exports; • formation of a new system of institutions for the broad liberalization of the fuel and energy market and improvement of the relevant regulatory and legal framework. In addition, the achievements of Turkey, the Russian Federation, the Federal Republic of Germany and Great Britain were analyzed and evaluated to determine the principles of transition to the liberal market model in the second chain of the national energy sector infrastructure complex. The main components of this advanced practice have also been unified for application. Also, based on the analysis and research carried out in accordance with the requirements of the law of the “Republic of Azerbaijan on efficient use of energy resources and energy efficiency”, the author has prepared a scheme reflecting the transition of the National Electric Power system to a liberal market model. Based on the analysis and assessments covering both links of the energy sector, the author has developed an oligopolistic market model of the national energy infrastructure complex. The classification composition of the transformation of the optimal infrastructure complex in the national energy sector includes the following: • deposits and gas supply organizations located in dry areas are excluded from the structure of SOCAR and he continues to work as a transnational company that exploits offshore oil fields. In its structure, it retains its assets outside the country, as well as oil refining, deep foundations production and other directly necessary service areas. At the same time, it is considered appropriate to include in its functions the production of renewable energy sources; • a separate oil and gas producer concern is being set up in public-private cooperation, which manages the oil and gas industry in onshore areas from exploration to filling stations. The concern also implements a strategy for renewable energy production by converting some of the mining areas into energy farms (solar, wind, hydrogen, fast-growing plants and ethanol production by planting trees). • a separate vertically integrated state gas company is established, which carries out the reception, treatment, processing, storage, transportation and supply of gas. It also includes carbamide and methanol plants operating directly on gas raw materials. The gas distribution area is fully or partially allocated for privatization or transferred to private companies in pilot form for management; • the independence of the oil and gas chemistry complex is also assessed separately. At the same time, it is expedient to join “SOCAR Polymer” Plant, which produces polymers, into this complex; • In line with the reforms carried out in the country, the electric power sector is moving to a liberal market Model. Power plants remain in the state's view at the initial stage. Taking into account the strategic goals of the state, starting with relatively small power plants, their transfer or full privatization to independent and mixed management on the basis of rigid investment agreements is considered. In this sphere “Transmission System Operator for electric power” is being created, which includes high voltage transmission lines under full control of the state. In addition, the organization “Market Operator for electric energy” is established, which carries out the processes of wholesale electricity in the energy system, and is also under the full control of the state. In the distribution network system of electricity, full or partial privatization is carried out. The final results of our analysis on the formation of an optimal infrastructure complex in the national energy sector show that a fundamental transition to a liberal market model should be made in the country, and an optimal infrastructure complex should be formed here. The new infrastructure complex should be formed in an oligopolic model, reflecting the achievements of the most progressive world experience. Natural, environmental, political and economic factors that optimally influence the Bur sphere should be taken into account, the tariff and tax system should be improved, and the next stage of development in the energy sector should find continuous stimulation within the framework of Public-Private Partnership.

      " \n",
      "Helium demand is expected to double within the next two decades given its essential role as a cryogenic fluid and an inert gas in various technological applications whereas its production capacity only increases by 3% per year, leading to an inevitable rising price of helium in the near future. Despite its status as the second most abundant element in the universe, natural gas is currently the only most commercially viable source for helium extraction. However, the common practice of most natural gas industries, at the present, is to let its helium component remains mixed with other gases throughout the gas supply chain processes until the final venting step. Helium recovery unit should instead be integrated as the last unit operations component of the liquefied natural gas plant to exploit the extra revenue from helium recovery. This review aims to validate the potential of membrane technology to be utilized in such separation unit since membrane may provide significant economic incentive over the cryogenic distillation or pressure swing adsorption processes. Five different membranes, i.e., polymer, silica, zeolite, metal-organic framework, and mixed matrix metal-organic framework membranes are surveyed in terms of their helium or hydrogen separation permeation performance and the related stabilities during permeation processes. In the absence of helium permeation data, hydrogen permeation data is considered as the closest representative data for helium permeation due to their kinetic diameter proximity.Literature shows that silica membrane provides the best prospect in terms of helium permeability and selectivity to other large molecular gases due to its molecular sieving mechanism. Silica membrane also enables thermal activated diffusion and operation at high temperature, i.e., below 600–800°C, over which silica matrix starts to densify. These advantages however are offset by the relatively complicated and time consuming synthesis and low reproducibility. Polymer membrane, although offering the most practical production process and scalability, exhibits relatively low helium permeability and selectivity. Zeolite membrane, albeit its high thermal and chemical stability, rarely possesses effective pore size smaller than the kinetic diameter of helium; thus making it more applicable as a substrate for another less stable but more selective membrane layer. Metal-organic framework membrane presents higher possibility to tailor its pore size than zeolite membrane due to the various possible combinations of inorganic clusters and organic linkers. Still, it shows relatively low helium to other large gases selectivity due to the flexibility imparted by the organic component. Mixed matrix membrane which incorporates metal-organic framework additive into predominantly polymer matrix, enhances helium to other large gases selectivity with respect to metal-organic framework membrane, though at the cost of reduced helium permeability. This review furthermore discusses all important issues related to the practical application of each type of membranes. It is hopeful that the insights provided by this review can promote more studies of membranes for helium separation.\n",

      " \n",
      "THE author's name does not appear on the title-page of this pamphlet, so that it was not till we had inflicted ourselves with its contents that we discovered at the end the signature William Coutie. The author, judging from the present production, is referable to that class of visionary speculators which includes among its numbers circle, squarers, seekers for perpetual motion, and those who perform what we may call arithmetical juggles with the atomic weights of the chemical elements. First comes a preface containing an extract from Priestley's narrative of the discovery of oxygen to which we shall again refer; after which follows a page headed “From the Acid Relations of the Elements” 1871, from which we select the two first paragraphs:— “I have now examined all the well-known elements with so much care that I cannot believe any general mistake possible, and find they are all compounds of hydrogen and three others whose weights are exact multiples of the weight of hydrogen. It is probable, therefore, they are all hydrogen; but before saying more I would request the aid of your skill in proving the above by experiment or the favour of your remarks so that I may correct errors or make the subject more clear or complete.” We now lay before our readers the state in which Mr. Coutie leaves the question of the origin of the sun's heat. After demonstrating to his own satisfaction that none of the existing hypotheses are sufficient to account for this supply of heat, the author makes a series of statements leading up to the following conclusion, which must be allowed to speak for itself:— “As the energy of the earth in its orbit is 26,900 miles, and the reversing force of gravity in a year is four times greater, or 107,600 miles, and the energy required to melt ice 142½° × 772 feet = 20 males, the reversing of its motion by gravity, if converted into heat, would melt the weight of itself of ice 5,380 times a year, and would melt a mass of ice equal to the mass of the sun in 60 years, or in the same time the whole known heat of the sun would. But if the sun's heat is the direct result of this action, the total heat of the sun ought not to be the equivalent of the reversed energy of the earth, but ought to be the equivalent of the whole system; but it is the equivalent of the earth's energy in orbit. We have therefore found what we sought for, and, as usual in such cases, it is not as we expected, and if we had hit it exactly, we would have found ourselves as far as ever from the end of that chain which stretches across infinity. We therefore withdraw our surmises and leave it as it is to the labours of others.” The next section treats of “the nature and relations of the chemical elements,” the research (?) which has led to the results announced having been undertaken because the atmosphere of the earth mainly consisting of nitrogen the author determined to find out what nitrogen was “with a view of finding the process by which the system is formed.” It is probably out of respect for his reader's feelings that the author does not at once disclose the astounding discovery which is to revolutionise chemical science, but leads the imagination gently up to it—first informing us that he has spent his life in trying to practise the precepts of Newton and Watt—then indulging in a series of disparaging remarks on modern chemical theory, which remarks we may state en passant, perfectly bristle with mis-statements. The discovery which we are now approaching is, we are told, the result of an attempt to apply mechanical principles to chemistry—then the author lets us into a trait of his personal character, after which comes the dénouement. Here it is: “What I claim is the discovery of an element whose weight is 5; it combines directly with nitrogen, and forms fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and iodine; with carbon, and forms oxygen and sillicon (sic.); and with hydrogen and forms sulphur and lithium.” This extraordinary and pantogenic element “is best described as being the opposite of hydrogen,” which “opposition constitutes its energy, and this energy constitutes, or rather will constitute the science of chemistry. Its combinations, direct and indirect, with hydrogen, carbon, and nitrogen, form all the other elements except phosphorus.” In the new chemistry potassium is “ammonia acid,” sodium, “ammonium acid,” lithium, and sulphur, “hydrogen acids,” &c. We find no evidence in the pamphlet of the method employed in discovering the new element—before listening to Mr. Coutie's vague speculations, chemists will be justified in calling upon him to produce his Pantogen, and describe its properties—at present it exists only on paper. We may appropriately conclude this notice with a quotation from Priestley, printed by the author in the preface to the present rhapsody. “For my own part I will frankly acknowledge that at the commencement of the experiments recited in this section, I was so far from having formed any hypothesis that led to the discoveries I made in pursuing them, that they would have appeared very improbable to me had I been told of them.” Mr. Coutie lays this missile so very temptingly within our reach, that we may be excused for throwing it at his very fragile fabric.\n",

      "This paper describes the performance and/or CO2 intensities of a Bio-DME (Biomass Di-methyl Ether) production system, considering the differences of biomass feedstock. In the past LCA studies on an energy chain model, there is little knowledge on the differences of biomass feedstock and/or available condition. Thus, in this paper, we selected Papua New Guinea (PNG) which has good potential for supply of an energy crop (a short rotation forestry), and Japan where wood remnants are available, as model areas. Also, we referred to 9 species of biomass feedstock of PNG, and to 8 species in Japan.The system boundary on our LCA consists of (1) the pre-treatment process, (2) the energy conversion process, and (3) the fuel transportation process. Especially, since the pre-treatment process has uncertainties related to the moisture content of biomass feedstock, as well as the distance from the cultivation site to the energy plant, we considered them by the Monte Carlo simulation.Next, we executed the process design of the Bio-DME production system based on the basic experimental results of pyrolysis and char gasification reactions. Due to these experiments, the gas components of pyrolysis and the gasification rate under H2O (steam) and CO2 were obtained. Also, we designed the pressurized fluid-bed gasification process. In a liquefaction process, that is, a synthesis process of DME, the result based on an equilibrium constant was used. In the proposed system, a steam turbine for an auxiliary power was assumed to be equipped, too. The energy efficiencies are 39.0–56.8 LHV-%, depending upon the biomass species.Consequently, CO2 intensities in the whole system were 16.3–47.2g-CO2/MJ-DME in the Japan case, and 12.2–36.7g-CO2/MJ-DME in the PNG one, respectively.Finally, using the results of CO2 intensities and energy efficiencies, we obtained the regression equations as parameters of hydrogen content and heating value of a feedstock. These equations will be extremely significant when we install the BTL (biomass-to-liquid, ex. Bio-DME) energy system in the near future, in order to mitigate CO2 emissions effectively, and to estimate the energy’s efficiency.\n",

      "CLK-1 in worms and COQ7 in humans function in both the mitochondria and nucleus.  By regulating metabolism, mitochondria supply cells with energy, modulate cellular redox balance, and affect organismal longevity. CLK-1 in worms and COQ7 in humans are targeted to mitochondria, are cleaved to become trapped in these organelles, and then function in the biosynthesis of ubiquinone, a cofactor in the electron transport chain. Worms and mice lacking the respective genes exhibit altered mitochondrial metabolism and increased life span. Monaghan et al . detected the uncleaved form of these proteins in the nucleus. The proportion of the uncleaved, nuclear form was increased by exposing worms or HeLa cells to hydrogen peroxide and was reduced by exposure to an antioxidant. Replacing COQ7 with a R28A mutant that could not localize to the nucleus reduced proliferation without affecting ubiquinone production. Adding a single copy of a nuclear-targeted, truncation mutant of CLK-1 (CLK-1 nuc ) in clk-1 -null worms did not rescue ubiquinone production but did reduce the amount of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Paraquat causes redox stress by inhibiting mitochondrial respiration, and more CLK-1 nuc worms survived paraquat exposure than clk-1 -null worms.CLK-1 nuc partially rescued and wild-type CLK-1 completely rescued the increased life span of clk-1 -null worms. Nuclear CLK-1 or COQ7 stimulated the expression of some genes (for example, that encoding mitochondrial glutaminase) and repressed that of others (for example, those encoding the oxidoreductase WWOX, superoxide dismutase, and the proapoptotic mitochondrial protease HTRA2). Expression of the gene encoding the proapoptotic mitochondrial protease HTRA2 was increased in cells expressing only R28A COQ7 (mitochondrial COQ7), and redox-stress-induced death of these cells with only was reduced by inhibition of this protease. Nuclear CLK-1 or COQ7 inhibited the UPR mt (mitochondrial unfolded protein response). Collectively, the data suggested that the balance of nuclear and mitochondrial CLK-1 and COQ7 influences the redox status of the cell and mitochondrial stress responses to control life span.   R. M.

      "The Iberian Pyrite Belt (SW Iberia) is one of the largest sulfur anomalies in the Earth's crust. In the southern Iberian Pyrite Belt, more than 820Mt of exhalative massive sulfides were deposited in less than one million years at the Devonian–Carboniferous boundary. The shale of the ore-bearing horizon contains biomarkers indicating major biogenic activity in a methanogenic setting, including a five-fold increase in typical vascular plant biomarkers and a significant anomaly in those probably indicating the presence of thermophilic Archaea. This contrasts with signatures in the average sedimentary rocks of the basin that indicate the sediments settled in oxic to sub-oxic environments, and that they have only minor biomarkers derived from continental paleoflora. These data show that the formation of the mineralization was not only related to major hydrothermal activity synchronous with volcanism but may also have been controlled by the input of large amounts of organic matter, mostly derived from the degradation of woodland detritus sourced in the nearby continent. This massive influx of organic matter could have accelerated extremophilic microbial activity that used short-chain hydrocarbons as electron donors for seawater sulfate reduction, resulting in concomitant massive sulfide precipitation. We propose that the giant massive sulfide deposits resulted from overlapping of geological and biological processes that occurred at the Devonian to Carboniferous transition, including: (1) continent collision during the onset of the Variscan orogeny leading to major paleogeographic changes and volcanism; (2) dramatic stress of continental ecosystems due to the combination of climatic change, volcanism, variations in the sea level and erosion on a regional scale; (3) major biomass destruction and increase of organic supply to marine environments; and, (4) generation of anoxic conditions and the thriving of sulfate reducing microorganisms. Under these conditions, massive sulfide deposits formed where venting sulfur-poor but metal-rich hydrothermal brines flowed into a hydrogen sulfide-rich anoxic water column. The data presented strongly suggest that there was a temporal and causal relationship between the Devonian–Carboniferous geotectonic, climatic and biological crises and the formation of the giant volcano-sedimentary massive sulfide deposits of the southern Iberian Pyrite Belt.\n",

      "The Palaeocene-Eocene organic sedimentary archives comprising lignites, carbonaceous shales, and shales from the Palana Formation of the Bikaner-Nagaur Basin, Rajasthan, India, are investigated in this study using elemental and biogeochemical proxies. The objectives of this investigation are to elucidate the sources of organic matter and their responses to palaeoredox and palaeoclimatic conditions, as well as to reconstruct the palaeoenvironment of the organic matter deposition. Elemental distributions, Rock Eval pyrolysis, stable carbon isotope, n-alkane and its ratios, acyclic isoprenoids and terpenoid biomarkers are employed as the tools to carry out this research. The hydrogen index shows that the samples contain type III, admixed type II-III and type II kerogen. The presence of admixed type II-III kerogen in the samples may indicate mixing of terrestrial plant-derived organic matter with autochthonous organic matter in a coastal depositional setting. Deposition in a coastal setting may also raise the possibility of organic matter supply from coastal vegetation. The large HI values (>300 mg HC/g TOC) may result from selective preservation of hydrogen-rich biomolecules derived from terrestrial and coastal vegetation. The stable carbon isotopic composition of bulk organic matter (−30.66 to −25.51‰) and the organic carbon to organic nitrogen ratio (26.62–131.12) may suggest that the organic matter was sourced primarily from C3 plants. The integration of these two parameters may also indicate that mangroves supplied significant amount of organic matter to the coastal peatland. The n-alkane distributions and carbon preference indices show the derivation of organic matter from waxy terrestrial plants, aquatic submerged vegetation, and microbial communities. The palaeohydrological proxies, i.e., proxy-aqueous ratio (0.24–0.86), proxy-wax ratio (0.33–0.84), and average chain length (26.32–28.30) may illustrate intermittent changes in organic matter sources (mangrove-dominated emergent vegetation and waxy plants to aquatic submergent plants and vice-versa) and their relations with shifts in palaeohydrological conditions of mire and associated palaeoclimatic oscillations between wet (high rainfall) and dry spells (low rainfall). Additionally, terpenoid distributions reveal organic matter input from angiosperms (including mangroves) (olean-12-ene, de-A-olean-13(18)-ene, de-A-lupane, and other de-A-triterpenoids), conifers (C18 diterpane, abietane, and ent-beyerane) and microbial sources (hopanoids). Besides, regarding the palaeodepositional environment, acyclic isoprenoid distributions (pristane and phytane), relative hydrocarbon potential, and the newly introduced palaeoredox factor may put forward mostly suboxic to oxic redox conditions of organic matter deposition. The total organic carbon and sulfur contents may further imply deposition of organic matter in topogenous-transitional mire conditions under a marginal marine/coastal environment. In complementary, the ranges of production index (0.01–0.19), Tmax (388–422 °C) and the presence of 17β(H),21β(H)-hopanes (ββ hopanes), 17α(H),21β(H)-homohopane, hop-17(21)-ene, ββ-hopanes, norhopanes and angiosperm-derived unsaturated triterpenoids may suggest thermal immaturity of organic matter in the studied samples.\n",

The object of this paper is to supply data at various temperatures for the heats of solution and dilution and evaporation, both of sulphuric acid and oleum. Pre-existing data apply only to atmospheric temperatures; but technical processes take place at various temperatures up to 200° C. or above. These additional data are obtained by indirect methods either from vapour pressures (of H2O or SO3) by means of Clapeyron's formula or from thermal capacities.—W. R. Bousfield: Isopiestic solutions. Solutions of KC1, LiCl, NaCl, and KNO3 of equal vapour pressure are placed together in an exhausted vessel, so that interchange of aqueous vapour may take place. Hence is indicated an accurate method of determining the vapour pressure of an aqueous solution, by comparison with the equal vapour pressure of a solution of LiCl. The observations lead to the conclusion that for a pure salt without water of crystallisation there is, at a given temperature, a certain vapour pressure of water below which the dry salt surrounded bv aqueous vapour will not take up water, and will, if it is not dry, become dried. This pressure may be called the critical hydratidn pressure of the salt at the given temperature.—Dr. J, W. McBain: Notes on the system of recording rate of chemical reaction. The usual equation representing rate of reaction may be written in the form fci = (remainder of expression). The author proposes so to choose the unit of time that fe is always unity.

      "Oxidative stress is an essential metabolic outcome in aerobic organisms due to the activity of mitochondria in providing the basic energy of cells or during the operation of several enzymatic pools (NADH-oxidases, NADPH-oxidases, NO-synthases, etc.) in recycling or producing important molecules. It also serves to regulate the size and shape of organs or restructure them during foetal development by apoptosis. The same occurs in organs (e.g., liver, bones) at the adult stage to control cell populations. Oxidative stress is also indispensable to the immune system by allowing macrophages to eliminate virus, bacteria and impaired or dead cells through phagocytosis. In fact, no aerobic organism could live without oxidative stress.   Albeit these numerous benefits of oxidative stress explain why evolution maintain these essential mechanisms in aerobic organisms, they are associated to highly negative issues. Indeed, oxidative stress mechanisms provide a variety of life-harmful radicals and species called generically Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) and Reactive Nitrogen Species (RNS) whose fluxes need to be finely controlled to avoid the destruction of most organic molecules (e.g., lipids in cell membranes, enzymes, etc.) and biological ones (DNA, proteins, etc.) in cells. Thus, under normal conditions, a panoply of dedicated antioxidants and specific enzymatic systems (e.g., superoxide dismutase, catalase, etc.) is present in cells and ensures a fine homeostatic balance. However, rupture of this delicate balance is frequent and may provoke severe damages in cells and tissues that are important causative factors in many human pathologies (aging, cancers, AIDS, hearth and brain strokes, Parkinson and Alzheimer’ diseases, etc.) when their rates of occurrence exceed the capabilities of repairing systems.    All these important issues are well documented in medicine and biology but only through their long and middle terms outcomes in cells, tissues and organisms. However, investigations of the primary nature and effects of ROS and RNS remained impossible for long time because of the lack of analytical methods with adequate time and space resolutions. Using platinized carbon fiber ultramicroelectrodes positioned in an “artificial synapse” configuration we could establish that the so-called “oxidative stress cellular bursts” consist into the release of a reproducible cocktail involving a few femtomoles of hydrogen peroxide, nitric oxide, peroxynitrite and nitrite ions per cell. Our results have quantitatively confirmed that these species stem from the simultaneous and coupled initial production of superoxide and NO° by two separated pre-existing enzymatic pools: NADPH-oxidases (O 2 ° - ) and NO-synthases (NO°).    The same methodology also allows a precise kinetic and analytical characterization of the nature of functional hyperemia, viz., of the fine-tuning mechanism coupling neuronal activity and local blood flux supply in the brain. Besides its functions in supplying oxygen, glucose, etc., to the active brain areas, this mechanism underlies the present imaging methods (f-IRM, PET scans) used in investigating the working brain or for medical purposes. We investigated this process on single stellate neurons from perfused rat cerebellum slices and could establish for the first time that active neurons signal their need for increased blood supplies by emitting pulses of locally important concentrations of NO° (up to 500 nM). These fluxes were shown to develop over ca 50 µm around the active neuron to induce the opening of vascular constrictions in nearby capillaries allowing them to deliver oxygen and nutrients to the active brain cells. This process is extremely intense but specifically tailored to only activate blood capillaries in the near vicinity of active neurons. Since neurons act cooperatively along chains, it is inferred that under normal physiological conditions, a whole brain area may be irrigated by larger blood flows while being active, which is precisely what is reported by f-IRM or PET-scans.    Therefore, two fluxes (O 2 and NO°) coexist in active parts of the brain. As such, this is not a problem. However, when free copper(II)-containing Amyloid-beta and ascorbate molecules are also present this ought to initiate a dangerous radical-chain process leading to the fast Cu(I)/Cu(II)-catalyzed production of protonated peroxynitrite (HO-ONO). This lipophilic species has enough stability to diffuse over several tens of a micrometer. When penetrating into neuron membranes, it spontaneously decomposes into OH° and NO 2 °. OH° leads to the fast creation of nanopores in the cell membrane, disrupting it and provoking apoptosis. We could fully establish the validity of this mechanism based on our analytical measurements and DFT investigations. Though overseen by the medical community, this mechanism may thus contribute to installing Alzheimer disease.\n",

      "The dependence on fossil fuels in developed countries is causing increasing concern. Global warming, issues related to peak oil, sustainability issues, and mounting concern for national energy security are the main drivers for a worldwide effort toward a reduction in fossil fuel consumption. The challenge is substantial, because fossil resources are such an integral part of our economy. However, there are many efforts to address this challenge. Development of conversion technologies fed by renewable resources is seen as a promising option. Many technologies for renewable energy are already well-developed and competitive in the market. Emerging technologies include biorefinery complexes, where biomass is used as a renewable carbon-based source for the production of bioenergy and biochemicals. The latter is perceived as a promising alternative to oil-based chemicals. Given the constraints on availability for renewable biomass supply, the importance of efficient use of biomass with a maximization of useful final products is well-acknowledged. Assessing the potentials for biochemicals can be achieved with an a priori estimation of the maximum theoretical yields, as well as a prediction of the conversion efficiencies (in terms of mass, carbon, and energy efficiency) of selected biorefinery production chains. This paper addresses this issue, providing a calculation procedure with which the theoretical yields and efficiencies of some biorefinery systems are estimated. Among the possible biomass sources, lignocellulosic biomass is selected as the raw material, because it is the most-widespread renewable source available in the world, it is locally available in many countries, and it does not compete with food and feed industries. The conversion of biomass to biofuels and chemicals requires conversion of the feedstock from a solid to a liquid state, but also the addition of hydrogen and rejection of excess oxygen, together with other undesired elements. The carbon contents of lignocellulosic biomass components (cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin) and products are calculated with the help of mathematical equations, and then the chemical reactions for the conversion of feedstock to products are modeled using matrix algebra: the maximum amount of biofuels and/or biochemicals from biomass and the maximum mass, energy, and carbon conversion efficiency of the biorefinery pathway are determined. Following this calculation procedure, an application to some biorefinery systems is performed and discussed. Combining the best feedstock with the most promising final products, results show that up to 0.33 kg of bioethanol, 0.06 kg of furfural, and 0.17 kg of FT-diesel per kg of softwood can be produced and mass, carbon, and energy conversion efficiencies of 56%, 70%, and 82%, respectively, are achieved.\n",

      "Transporting goods around the world with ships is nowadays the most cost-effective solution and due to this reason, more than four-fifths of the entire global trade by volume is carried out by sea. This leads to the estimation concerning emissions of the International Maritime Organization (IMO), that international shipping was in 2014 responsible for 2,2% of global annual CO 2 emissions and that these emissions could increase between 50% and 250% by 2050. Besides the CO 2 and greenhouse gas (CHG) emissions ships, which are conventionally fueled with heavy fuel oil (HFO) or marine diesel oil (MDO), also emit nitrogen oxides (NO x ) and sulphur oxides (SO x ). These emissions and especially the SO x emissions are regulated by the IMO in the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL: Annexe VI). Because of these regulations and more stringent self-imposed targets of several nations and organizations, the demand for alternative fuels and propulsion systems for the maritime transport sector is increased significantly. [1] [2] [6]   In order to meet these and more stringent upcoming regulations, ammonia, which can be produced by renewable energy sources (green ammonia), is proposed as a potential fuel for the maritime transport sector. Beside the fact, that green ammonia would lead to no CO 2 emissions, ammonia in relation to other renewable fuels can be seen as a balanced solution concerning the volumetric energy density and renewable synthetic production cost. Moreover, ammonia is advantageous compared to hydrogen, because of its lower cost per unit of stored energy, more widespread production, handling and distribution capacity and better commercial viability. But there are also some concerns and challenges for the application of ammonia as a ship fuel, namely the toxicity and the environmental impact. Therefore, some safety measures have to be established like shut-off valves in case of leakage and redundancy in the fuel supply line. Furthermore, one big concern of ammonia is the relative low efficiency value of the corresponding efficiency chain, when ammonia is produced via Haber-Bosch process, because of the production of the hydrogen as a basis for this process. For this reason, also the direct production of ammonia via proton ceramic electrolysis will be reviewed. [2] [3] [4] [6]  Because of the fact, that ammonia is not as practicable for any ship type, the load points for the simulation of the investigated propulsion systems are also described in this paper. Research shows, that ammonia as a fuel for container ships and bulk carrier is the most useful way of application. [3] [5]  For further investigations, the solid oxid fuel cell (SOFC) is chosen as the basis propulsion for the ship, because of the possible direct use of ammonia and its good efficiency compared to other systems namely internal combustion engine (ICE) or PEMFC. In detail, the aim is, to investigate by simulation (Matlab/Simulink) three possible solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) architectures, which are fueled with ammonia, and to compare their thermodynamic efficiency for marine applications representative operation points. The simulation output is used to answer the main research question: [3]   How thermodynamically efficient are different SOFC system architectures for marine applications powered by ammonia?    An Outlook on testing of a 5 kW Lab System is presented to validate the simulative results.

      "One of the contenders for a clean source of on-board electric power in a vehicle is the fuel cell: an electrochemical device that transforms the chemical energy stored in a fuel directly into electricity. While less widely known and less far advanced than batteries, fuel cells hold a considerable potential to provide the power for a novel generation of non-polluting vehicles. At present, fuel cell technology is entering the stage of commercialization, which is an appropriate moment to try and assess its economic potential in the field of transport. Based on a review of the present state of the technology, concentrating on the solid polymer fuel cell, a model is set up of a fleet of urban buses, widely regarded as one of the earliest applications of fuel cells in transport. Under the central assumption that the fuel cell stack cost is $300 per kilowatt, the fuel cell bus is found to be around 30% more expensive than its diesel counterpart. However, there are considerable cost reductions possible through economies of scale in the production of hydrogen, the fuel required for the solid polymer fuel cell. Remarkably, these economies of scale allow the cost of the fuel cell bus to drop below that of the diesel. What is more, the fleet size required for this—more than 25 vehicles—is by no means prohibitive. In a trade-off analysis, the possibility is investigated of reducing the cost by allowing one parameter to deteriorate, if this permits another one to improve. In particular, it is found that cheaper (mass-) production techniques for the fuel cell at the expense of reduced efficiency make economic sense if a relative drop in the efficiency of 1% is accompanied by a cost reduction of at least 1⋅06%—something that is likely to be attainable. A scenario for a direct methanol fuel cell, assuming a cost per kilowatt three times as high as for the solid polymer fuel cell, results in a slightly higher overall cost, without being able to offer the same economies of scale in fuel provision. The social costs are calculated also, taking into account the environmental externalities associated with the whole system including the fuel supply chain. The inclusion of externalities fails to shift the balance decisively in favour of the fuel cell, partly because of a cancellation effect between the diesel tax, which has to be excluded in a social cost calculation, and the externalities, which are added in. The main outcome is therefore that in order to succeed in the marketplace, the principal task for the developers of fuel cells is a further reduction of the cost. © 1997 by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.\n",

      "The most important tasks in the previous century are to develop fuel cells as alternative electrochemical devices for efficient generation of energy. The low-temperature acid-type systems, such as hydrogen-oxygen polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells and direct alcohol fuel cells are, at present, the most commonly studied devices in many laboratories world-wide [1-8]. Among organic compound fuels for anodic reactions in fuel cells, methanol has been historically most extensively studied and, more recently, alternative liquid fuels like a short chain alcohol (such as ethanol, ethylene glycol) becomes essential. It is well established that Pt is rated as the most active material for oxidation of small organic molecules in acidic media but the easily poisoning by intermediate byproduct – CO adsorb species the binary or ternary platinum-based alloys with Ru, Sn, Rh, Pb, Ir, W or Mo were proposed to enhance the electrooxidation activity towards alcohols[1-8]. The splitting of the C–C bonds is particularly difficult at ambient (low) temperatures, and the surface of catalytic platinum readily undergoes poisoning with intermediates of the ethylene glycol or ethanol oxidation. This problem may be partially solved by applying bifunctional electrocatalysts. Metals, like ruthenium, tin or rod may activate molecules of water and supply strong oxidizing agents: –OH groups and thus remove adsorbed species from platinum surface.  In order to increase the overall kinetic of electrooxidation of ethylene glycol or ethanol, we propose modification of bifunctional, metallic catalyst with metal oxide. Our concept involves adsorption onto the surface of commercial available Pt alloys nanoparticles ultra-thin layers of tungsten oxide, molybdenum oxide, zirconium oxide or iridium oxide. Presence of metals oxide (WO 3, MoO 3, ZrO 2 , IrO 2 ) on nanoparticle have led not only to the specific interactions but also increased the catalytic surface. Introduction of noble metals oxide to Pt-based alloy nanoparticles lead to the increase of the catalytic current under voltammetric and chronoamperometric conditions.    References :  [1] M. Li, D.A.

      "Balance-of-Plant (BOP) cost for PEM fuel cell systems are now equal to or exceeding the cost of PEM fuel cell stack. The fuel cell systems cost analyses funded by the Fuel Cell Technologies Office (FCTO) of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) confirms the near equivalency of the BOP cost to fuel cell stack cost for PEM fuel cells in the studies by Battelle[1], Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory[2], and Strategic Analysis Inc.[3]. The cost equivalency between the BOP and the PEM fuel cell stack is observed over the full spectrum of fuel cell applications; Material Handling Equipment (MHE) fuel cell systems, stationary fuel cell systems, automotive fuel cell systems. James et al[4]evaluated PEM automotive fuel cell costs and found that at production rates of 30,000 automotive units per year or greater the BOP cost were more than the PEM fuel cell stack cost, as shown in Figure 1. Battelle[5] reports the BOP cost is 3.5X the cost of the fuel cell stack in their analysis of the cost of a PEM 10 kW fuel cells for MHE; these data are represented in Figure 2 where the balance of plant is 59% of the fuel cell system cost at production rates of 10,000 MHE fuel cell systems per year. For a PEM 100 kW hydrogen fueled stationary fuel cell systems, Wei and McKone[6]of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) reported the ratio of BOP-to-stack cost is 1.3 at production rates of 1,000 hydrogen fueled units per year. For a PEM 100 kW reformate fueled stationary power plants, the LBNL data demonstrate the ratio of BOP to fuel cell stack cost is 1.1 for a production rate of 10,000 fuel cell systems per year. LBNL evaluated smaller hydrogen fueled PEM stationary, backup power (BUP) systems and the ratio of BOP to fuel cell stack cost was 1.5 for a 10 kW system. At BUP system production levels of 50,000, the ratio of BOP-to-fuel cell stack cost increased to 2.3 in the LBNL data.  A three part approach to improving BOP performance, durability and reduced cost is:    Increasing awareness of BOP specifications for performance, durability and cost within the supply chain.    Optimization of manufacturing processes to reduce cost of BOP components    Development of fuel cell system BOP components that meet original equipment manufacturers specifications.     Increasing awareness of BOP specifications: For many years, the approach to fuel cell BOP components has been to use Off The Shelf (OTS) components developed for non-fuel cell applications. Overall, this approach has not been successful because of a lack of awareness of the OEM specifications by the BOP manufacturers. The Ohio Fuel Cell Coalition brought the OEMs and BOP manufacturers together to share specifications, discuss manufacturing capabilities, and establish acceptable cost targets. The results of these exchanges will be presented.  Optimization of Manufacturing Processes for BOP Components: The FCTO has sponsored manufacturing R&D programs for the last three years. Manufacturing R&D for BOP components will be discussed and recommendations for optimization of manufacturing methods for specific BOP components presented. Development of Fuel Cell Balance-of-Plant Components: Replacement of OTS components that are mismatch for fuel cell applications will in many cases require alternative materials and specialized designs to meet the OEM durability and performance requirements. The R&D pathways to identify alternative materials and specialized designs will be discussed. References:  [1] K. Mahadevan, F. Eubanks, V. Contini, J. Smith, G. Stout, and M.

      "Coals are employed as fiery substance, and every day, millions of ton coal are consumed by coal users around the world. It is investigated that the millions of coal’s transportation/logistic till the coal user plants via road route and also inside the coal user plants (known as twice factors) not only enhance the air pollution but also cause the global warming. It is earlier known that coals emit the toxic pollutants and offensive gases such as sulfur dioxide, SO2; nitrogen oxides, NOX; hydrogen chloride arsenic; carbon monoxide, CO; methane; CH4; and CO2 on reacting with environmental O2 due to said twice factors, i.e., during the transportation from coal refinery spot to entry gate of coal user plants (another spot) and in process logistic/movement inside the coal user plants (loading to conveyor to coal fire tubes “attached with coal crushers”). Therefore, the coal refinery technique/process is found as the best practice to control air pollution under concerns of twice factors. The reliable and trustworthy coal refining technology improves the quality of coal by eradicating or eliminating the coating or layers of toxic particles from coal’s surface, which speedily crumble or decompose in reacting with environmental O2 under twice factors. As results, coal refining technology adds the green supply chain value into proposed twice factors and also save the world from breeding of ills and viruses. It is understood that the best coal refinery technique/process helps to overcome and reduce air pollution by responding discussed twice factors (accepted as research challenge and motivation of research). In the presented research work, the authors developed and proposed a dynamic multidimension Coal Refinery Process Absorbability Index (CRPAI) structure (consisted of coal refinery core dimension and subdimensions correspond to CRPA alternative techniques/processes) appended with Robust Optimization Algorithm (ROA) to be explored for opting the best CRP from available options. But due to inherent ambiguity, vagueness, and inconsistency involve in both dimensions of proposed structure, the assessment of expert’s panel is gathered in the terms of linguistic variable “appropriateness ratings” against the subdimensions of CRPAI structure corresponding to preferred CRP options. Next, assigned appropriateness ratings against the subdimensions are substituted by GIVFN. To arrive to core dimensions from subdimensions of CRPAI structure, a GITFN-OWGO (Ordered Weighted Geometric Operator) is investigated and modified as a Ordered Weighted Geometric Average Operator (OWGAO) to be applied for estimating the weights of subdimensions (core novelty of work). Finally, a ROA (consisted of MULTI-MOORA with dominance theory) is applied on the output of OWGAO for opting the viable and best CRP option. The positive effect of the dynamic multidimension CRPAI structure is that it helps the coal refinery companies to assess measure and evaluate the best and feasible coal refinery process under concern of twice factors using expert information. The research can be used to control the air pollution by responding aforesaid twice factors by single practice (the best coal refinery process/technique assessment and evaluation).\n",

      "LONDON. Royal Society, November 5.—L. Ballif, J. F. Fulton, and E. G. T. Liddell: Observations on spinal and decerebrate knee-jerks, with special reference to their inhibition by single break-shocks. Simultaneous mechanical torsion-wire myograph and electrical records have been obtained of knee-jerks in decerebrate and spinal preparations. The spinal knee-jerk differs from the decerebrate: the mechanical response of the spinal jerk is two to three times longer in duration than that of the decerebrate jerk (or the motor twitch); the curve of relaxation of the spinal jerk is different; the electrical response tends to be more prolonged in the spinal knee-jerk; the interval between the tap and the electrical response is greater in the spinal preparations; and the spinal jerk is more difficult to elicit. The shortest spinal knee-jerk observed seems to be produced by a repetitive discharge of at least 4 to 8 volleys of impulses recurring somewhat asynchronously at 100 to 200 per sec. Both spinal and decerebrate knee-jerks may be inhibited by a single appropriately timed break-shock applied to an ipsilateral afferent nerve, the former much more readily than the latter. When recovering from an inhibition, the spinal knee-jerk has the same duration as a twitch or a decerebrate knee-jerk.— K. Furusawa: (i) Muscular exercise, lactic acid, and the supply and utilisation of oxygen. Pt. xiii. The gaseous exchanges of restricted muscular exercise in man. A simple ergometer, capable of being worked at any speed by the arms, has been constructed. As regards oxygen requirement, there is a marked optimal speed but no optimal load. Oxygen intake rises much more slowly to its maximum value than it does in the case of exercise involving most of the muscles of the body. It seems that lactic acid produced in excess by violent activity of a localised group of muscles may diffuse from them into the blood, and thence to other parts of the body (particularly resting muscles and liver), and there be removed or restored to glycogen under the influence of oxidation occurring in those tissues. There appears, therefore, to be possibility of an exhaustion due to complete using up of lactic-acid precursor, when the exercise involved is localised in a small group of muscles. (2) A spirometer method of studying continuously the gaseous metabolism of man during and after exercise. A new method is described of studying continuously the rapidly altering gaseous metabolism of man during and after muscular exercise. A spirometer of large capacity is used, the gases inside it being kept continuously stirred, the total ventilation being measured every 10 litres, and samples being abstracted at intervals for analysis.—D. T. Harris: The effect of light on the circulation. Irradiation of a localised area of skin with ultra-violet energy causes a widespread peripheral vaso-dilation. Consequently, only a very slight transitory rise of blood-pressure results from the small increase in pulse rate of from two to five per minute in dark and white subjects respectively. The reaction was always less in pigmented subjects. The vaso-dilator response to ultra-violet radiation is enhanced by a previous exposure; this is not the case with radiant heat. The vascular response appears to be a nervous reflex initiated by a nocuous stimulus; the whole phenomenon is one of incipient injury.—A. V. Hill: The surface tension theory of muscular contraction. The amount of lactic acid liberated when a muscle fibre i cm. long develops a force of i dyne is 1.46 ×10-11 gm. This is very nearly zo11 molecules. Spread out in a continuous mono-molecular film these would occupy about 2.1 x 10-4 sq. cm. If the mechanical response of muscle were due to a change of surface tension caused by such a film, the coefficient of surface tension required would be about 4800 dynes per centimetre. This is about 230 times the tension of a water— olive-oil interface, clearly an impossible value. Reckoned per gm. of muscle, the amount of lactic acid liberated in a maximal contraction of a frog's muscle is about 0.033 mgm. which would occupy an area of about 470 sq. cm.; i.e. about the surface area of the fibres composing the muscle.—J. F. Fulton and E. G. T. Liddell: Electrical responses of extensor muscles during postural (myotatic) contraction. Simultaneous mechanical and electrical records have been obtained of the responses of quadriceps femoris and rectus femoris of decerebrate cats to various forms of postural (myotatic) reflex. The knee-jerk seems to be produced by a somewhat asynchronous volley of impulses. The comparative absence of electrical responses in stretch reflex is due to complete asynchronism of afferent stimuli, for when a large number are recruited synchronously an action current invariably occurs. Since the exaggerated stretch reflex characteristic of the decerebrate condition is in large measure responsible for rigidity of extensor muscles in the decerebrate animal, we have inferred that these sustained postural reactions are produced by asynchronous all-or-nothing contractions of individual muscle fibres rather than by hypothetical fixing mechanisms.—L. N. Katz: On the supposed pluri-segmental innervation of muscle fibres. In the frog, when the two components of the sciatic nerve are stimulated in succession in an isometric tetanus, the sum of the tension developed is considerably greater than the tension produced when both components are stimulated simultaneously. The total heat developed on stimulating the two components of the sciatic nerve separately is, however, the same as that produced when they are stimulated simultaneously. This indicates that there is no pluri-segmental innervation of frog's muscle fibres apart from possible infrequent chance variations.—L. N. Katz and C. N. H. Long: Lactic acid in mammalian cardiac muscle. Pt. i. The stimulation maximum. The mammalian heart is dependent on its contemporary oxygen supply, and fails rapidly in its absence; the skeletal muscle, on the other hand, is independent at first of its contemporary oxygen supply. The data obtained from cats and rabbits show that the mean lactic-acid stimulation maximum of the heart is approximately one-third that of the skeletal muscle. The maximum “oxygen-debts” of these two tissues should therefore be in the same ratio.—H. J. G. Hines, L. N. Katz, and C. N. H. Long: Lactic acid in mammalian cardiac muscle. Pt. ii. The rigor mortis maximum and the normal glycogen content. The rigor mortis maximum, or the caffeine rigor maximum, of lactic acid in the heart is only half that in the skeletal muscle. A lack of lactic-acid precursor is not the cause of the relatively low stimulation maximum in the heart. The glycogen content of the heart is much smaller than that of skeletal muscle in well-fed cats. There is in the heart a greater discrepancy between resting glycogen content and the lactic acid produced in rigor mortis, than there is in skeletal muscle. It indicates that a greater portion of the lactic-acid precursor of the heart is in some other form than glycogen.—Phyllis Kerridge, L. N. Katz, and C. N. H. Long: Lactic acid in mammalian cardiac muscle. Pt. iii. Changes in hydrogen-ion concentration. The hydrogen-ion concentration of cardiac and of skeletal muscles stimulated to fatigue are different; the difference is of the order of o.2pH, the skeletal muscle being the more acid. In rigor mortis the difference is of the order of o.4pH, the skeletal muscle being the more acid. Cardiac and skeletal muscle have different buffering powers which vary at different pH's. The maximum difference is at approximately 6.3pH, when the ratio of the buffering power of skeletal to that of cardiac muscle is about 2: I.— W. E. Garner: The mechanism of muscular contraction. It is suggested that the tension generated on applying a stimulus to a muscle fibre is due to the formation of a solid film on the surfaces of the ultimate fibrils of the muscle. Liquid crystals composed of long-chain carbon compounds are present in the anisotropic segments of the muscle, and the molecules of the long-chain carbon compounds are orientated with their chains in a direction parallel to the axis of the fibre. It is suggested that glycogen is converted into sodium lactate according to the series of reversible reactions A ⇌ B ⇌ lactic acid, where A is a product formed from glycogen and B is an intermediate active form of both A and lactic acid. The direction of the chemical reaction may be influenced by alteration of the surface energy of the membranes during movements of the muscle. Wheri the energy liberated during the conversion of glycogen into lactic acid is not utilised in doing external work, it may be stored, in part, by a reversal of the reactions.—R. W. Riding and E. C.

      "For this feature, I have had the pleasure of reviewing 122 papers submitted to SPE in the field of offshore facilities over the past year. Brent crude oil price finally has reached $75/bbl at the time of writing. So far, this oil price is the highest since before the COVID-19 pandemic, which is a good sign that demand is picking up. Oil and gas offshore projects also seem to be picking up; most offshore greenfield projects are dictated by economics and the price of oil. As predicted by some analysts, global oil consumption will continue to increase as the world’s economy recovers from the pandemic. A new trend has arisen, however, where, in addition to traditional economic screening, oil and gas investors look to environment, social, and governance considerations to value the prospects of a project and minimize financial risk from environmental and social issues. The oil price being around $75/bbl has not necessarily led to more-attractive offshore exploration and production (E&P) projects, even though the typical offshore breakeven price is in the range of $40–55/bbl. We must acknowledge the energy transition, while also acknowledging that oil and natural gas will continue to be essential to meeting the world’s energy needs for many years. At least five European oil and gas E&P companies have announced net-zero 2050 ambitions so far. According to Rystad Energy, continuous major investments in E&P still are needed to meet growing global oil and gas demand. For the past 2 years, the global investment in E&P project spending is limited to $200 billion, including offshore, so a situation might arise with reserve replacement becoming challenging while demand accelerates rapidly. Because of well productivity, operability challenges, and uncertainty, however, opening the choke valve or pipeline tap is not as easy as the public thinks, especially on aging facilities. On another note, the technology landscape is moving to emerging areas such as net-zero; decarbonization; carbon capture, use, and storage; renewables; hydrogen; novel geothermal solutions; and a circular carbon economy. Historically, however, the Offshore Technology Conference began proactively discussing renewables technology—such as wave, tidal, ocean thermal, and solar—in 1980. The remaining question, then, is how to balance the lack of capital expenditure spending during the pandemic and, to some extent, what the role of offshore is in the energy transition. Maximizing offshore oil and gas recovery is not enough anymore. In the short term, engaging the low-carbon energy transition as early as possible and leading efforts in decarbonization will become a strategic move. Leveraging our expertise in offshore infrastructure, supply chains, sea transportation, storage, and oil and gas market development to support low-carbon energy deployment in the energy transition will become vital. We have plenty of technical knowledge and skill to offer for offshore wind projects, for instance. The Hywind wind farm offshore Scotland is one example of a project that is using the same spar technology as typical offshore oil and gas infrastructure. Innovation, optimization, effective use of capital and operational expenditures, more-affordable offshore technology, and excellent project management, no doubt, also will become a new normal offshore.

      "The purpose of this research is to develop a new material with a combination of functions of gel and fiber using electrospinning. Gel has a three-dimensional network structure that is usually synthesized by crosslinking the monomers in various ways. It is widely used in hygiene, cosmetic, fragrance, medicine and many others fields. Multi-functions like water absorbability, biocompatibility and flexibility, can be designed and given depending on the chemical structure of monomers and crosslinkers. We developed crystalline gels with high performance via introducing crystalline side chains into the three-dimensional network structure. There are many kinds of crosslinks to form three-dimensional network structure, such as covalent bonds, Coulomb force, hydrogen bonds, coordination bonds, bonds through entanglements, etc. Among these crosslinks, covalent bonds are most suitable for preparing high performance gels. We use photopolymerization to synthesize crystalline gels because it offers advantages including rapid curing rate, minimal heat production and temperature independence, compared to other polymerization techniques. Photopolymerization is a light-based technique that uses to initiate and propagate a polymerization reaction. To create crosslinked gels, at least three reactive components are required: photoinitiator, monomer and crosslinking agent. A photoinitiator creates free radicals upon exposure to specific wavelengths of light, and then initiates polymerization of monomer and crosslinking agent through a photolytic mechanism. In this research, our aim is to develop a novel gel fiber with a combination of functions of gel and fiber, and ultimately to develop gel nonwoven fabric. The gel nonwoven fabric is expected to have the properties such as water absorbability, biocompatibility, flexibility, and also air permeability, filtration and heat retention. The gel nonwoven fabric could be a promising material for the application in medical treatment due to its air and moisture adjustment function to prevent soaking of wound. Gel has a three-dimensional network structure, it does not dissolve in an organic solvent to make gel solution, and it is also difficult to be heated to make gel melt. Before gelation, only the droplets but no fibers can be formed via electrospinning because of the too low viscosity of reactive solution. On the other hand, after full gelation, fibers cannot be formed either due to their insolubility and infusibility deriving from three-dimensional network structure. Therefore, the manufacture of gel fibers is difficult. In this study, electrospinning with pre and post polymerization treatment is used to make gel nonwoven fabric. We propose to use prepolymerized solution with appropriate viscosity to undergo electrospinning. Electrospinning is a method capable of relatively easily preparing nanofibers under a high voltage. An electrospinning device generally consists of a high voltage power supply, a cylinder, and a substrate. The principle of the electrospinning method is that when a positive high voltage is applied to the polymer solution, charges are collected on the droplet surface at the tip of the nozzle and repel each other, and the droplets coming out of the nozzle gradually become conical. When the repulsive force of charge exceeds the surface tension, the solution is jetted straight from the tip of the cone, gradually heading toward the grounded or negatively charged substrate while drawing a spiral. As the ejected solution stream becomes thinner, the surface charge density increases, so the charge repulsion increases and the solution flow is further elongated. Prepolymerized gel solution is set in cylinder, distance between substrate and nozzle is determined, extrusion amount is set, and voltage is given. We run experiments with the procedure of sticking aluminum foil to the metal plate and then spraying the prepolymerizted gel solution onto the board, finally taking aluminum foil off the board and applying postpolymeriation under UV light. SEM observation indicated the fiber diameter is about 400 nm.\n",

      "In polymer electrolyte fuel cells (PEFCs), the cathode catalyst layer (CL) needs a large amount of Pt because of the slow oxygen reduction reaction. Since electron, proton, and oxygen are necessary for the cathode reaction in PEFCs, achieving the optimum structure of cathode CL and the efficient transport of the reactants is significantly effective to reduce the usage of Pt catalyst. Some researches reported that when Aquivion is used as the ionomer of the CL, the output voltage increases as compared with the CL using Nafion in the intermediate current density region (1). However, dominant factors improving the cell performance have not been elucidated quantitatively. In this study, the oxygen transport resistance at the Pt surface, which is thought to have a large contribution to the oxygen transport resistance inside the CL (2), was investigated using CLs fabricated with different ionomers. In this study, catalyst coated membranes was fabricated with various cathode structure: 6 types of cathode side CLs using three kinds of Pt-supported carbons (TEC10E30E, TEC10E50E, TEC10E70TPM) having different Pt carrying densities and two types of ionomer, Nafion and Aquivion. All of these CLs were fabricated with I/C = 0.8.  First, to distinguish the oxygen transport resistance in the CL from the other resistance such channels, I-V measurement experiments were conducted with different total pressures (0.10MPa, 0.15MPa, 0.20MPa), and the limiting current density method (2) was applied. In the I-V measurement, the flow rate of cathode gas (oxygen and nitrogen mixture) was 2000 sccm with different oxygen concentration (1%, 2%, 3%) and the flow rate of anode hydrogen was 100 sccm with RH 80% (80°C). Next, the oxygen transport resistance at the Pt surface was evaluated. (The details will be described later). In this evaluation, the electrochemical surface area (ECSA [m 2 /g Pt ]) in the CL is needed. The ECSA was estimated by CV measurement. In the CV measurement, cathode was filled with N 2 gas with RH 100% (80°C). The flow rate of anode hydrogen was 100 sccm with RH100% (80°C).   Figure 1 shows I-V characteristics of the CL with Pt loadings of approximately 0.20 mg/cm 2 . The output current density for the Aquivion based CL is higher than that of the Nafion based CL at a voltages around 0.5 V, whereas the Nafion based CL has superior performance in the operation at 0.1 V where oxygen supply is limited by various transport resistances. In this paper, we focus on the oxygen transport resistance at low voltage, in particular the resistance at the Pt surface, because the Pt surface resistance is considered to be dominant part of oxygen transport resistance under the low Pt loading CL.   Figure 2 shows the ECSA estimated from the CV measurement. The values of ECSA are similar with Nafion and Aquivion based CLs. As the Pt carrying density increases, the ECSA decreases. This is because the Pt particles aggregate on the carbon and the surface area becomes smaller. Using the simplified evaluation formula of oxygen transport resistance (2), the total oxygen transport resistance in the CL can be expressed as  R CL   =  R Pt  +  R diss  +  R pore  . The  R Pt  means the resistance at the Pt surface,  R diss  means the resistance of oxygen dissolves into ionomer, and  R pore  means the oxygen diffusion resistance in the CL pores. The  R Pt  is formulated as  R Pt  = 1 / (  A Pt  × γ ×  k Pt  ) (2). Here,  A Pt  is the reactive surface area of catalyst Pt per unit area of the CL, γ is ratio of oxygen concentration in the ionomer and CL pore, and  k Pt  [m/s] is the oxygen transfer rate constant at the Pt surface. Figure 3 shows the result evaluating  R Pt  with both ionomer based CLs. The ordinate represents  R CL  and the abscissa represents 1/  A Pt  . Using this result,  k Pt  can be calculated as  k Pt  = 1.5×10 -2 s/m with the Nafion based CL and  k Pt  = 9.1×10 -3 s/m with the Aquivion based CL. As the oxygen transport resistance at the Pt surface is inversely proportional to the  k Pt  , the resistance of Aquivion based CL is estimated to be larger. This indicates a possibility that Aquivion based CL is inferior due to its larger Pt surface resistance. The larger Pt surface resistance may be due to the characteristics of Aquivion: the shorter side chain and the hydrophilic property induce strongly condensed structure of Aquivion at the surface of Pt, and that results in inhibiting the transport of oxygen.

      "Introduction  Polymer electrolyte fuel cell (PEFC) is focused as a next-generation energy conversion system. In particular, PEFC is expected as an electrical power unit of automobile, a home electrical power supply and so on because it has high power density and high efficiency. The chemical reactions in PEFC, that is, dissociation reaction of hydrogen and water-generating reaction, occur on catalysts. In catalyst layers (CLs), there are Pt catalysts on supported carbon and ionomer films which cover the surface of those particles. Ionomer is composed of polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM), hydronium ions and water molecules. As ionomer becomes thick, proton transfer performance improves. Meanwhile, oxygen permeability decreases in cathode side. It is therefore required to find the condition in which both performances have good efficiency. These phenomena occur in microscopic structures, and it is difficult to analyze by experiments. For this reason, simulation is better than experiment for analytical approaches. In this study, we simulated a system of CLs of the cathode side by molecular dynamics simulation. In particular, we made a system of ionomer on Pt surface, and we calculated the number of permeated oxygen molecules in the ionomer, the density distribution of oxygen in the system and so on. Using these results, we analyzed oxygen permeability in the ionomer.  Simulation method  We simulated the system that is ionomer on Pt surface with DREIDING force field. Perfluorosulfonic acid (PESA) membranes, including Nafion developed by DuPont, are used worldwide for PEM. In addition to Nafion, we used hydrocarbon which is low-cost alternative to PFSA membranes. Firstly, all components of ionomer are set at random in the simulation domain, and then the system reaches to equilibrium state by annealing. Secondly, Pt surface is placed in the bottom of the domain, and the equilibrium ionomer membrane is set onto the surface. After that, the system reaches to equilibrium state by annealing again. In addition to this system, the gas region for oxygen molecules is set above the ionomer on Pt surface. We considered that all the oxygen molecules dissociate on Pt surface and that the reaction occurs much faster compared with its dissolution or diffusion. In actual phenomenon, dissociated oxygen molecules react with protons and electrons, and then water molecules ejected at an instant. In this simulation, oxygen molecules can pass through the Pt surface and return to the gas region to prevent the oxygen molecules from accumulating on the Pt surface. The pressures are set at 10 MPa in the gas region and 0 MPa in the bottom of the domain, respectively. The number of oxygen molecules is adjusted to be kept these pressures so that the mass flux of oxygen gases is kept constant in ionomer. Using this system, we sampled the number of permeated oxygen molecules in ionomer and calculated the density distribution of oxygen molecules with changing water content from 3 to 11. It is a parameter that means the ratio of the sum of water molecules and hydronium ions to the number of hydrophilic groups in side chains of the ionomer.  Results and Discussion  At the beginning, we sampled the number of permeated oxygen molecules in ionomer. It is the result that the permeability of oxygen decreases as water content increases in both Nafion-based ionomer and hydrocarbon-based ionomer. Next, we sampled the number of water molecules in each ionomer. In ionomer composed of Nafion, the value increases according to water content in the entire region. On the other hand, in ionomer composed of hydrocarbon, the value increases in the bulk region and the ionomer-gas interface, while the value does not change in the ionomer-Pt interface. In addition, the density distributions of oxygen molecules are shown in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2. The values decrease, as water content increases in both conditions. Moreover, the density distributions of Nafion, hydrocarbon, and water molecules in each ionomer are shown in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4. From these results, in Nafion-based ionomer, water molecules thrust into the void of the structure of Nafion in the ionomer-Pt interface, so the pathway for oxygen permeation decreases. In contrast, water molecules accumulate on hydrocarbon in ionomer-Pt interface, and they prevent oxygen molecules from permeating in hydrocarbon-based ionomer. We have calculated the solubility of oxygen molecules in ionomer. It is associated with the appearance of the pathway, so we will research the oxygen permeability in ionomer more closely. And then we will compare the result of hydrocarbon-based ionomer with that of Nafion-based ionomer.\n",

      "L'atténuation naturelle des BTEX (Benzène, Toluène, Ethyl-benzène, Xylène) et des solvants chlorés est de plus en plus étudiée en raison des potentialités offertes par cette technique de gestion. Cet article, après avoir présenté les aspects abiotiques de l'atténuation détaille les conditions chimiques nécessaires à la réalisation des réactions de biodégradation des polluants organiques. Les aspects thermodynamiques sont abordés afin de décliner les réactions possibles et celles qui ne le sont pas selon les environnements chimiques. La dégradation des BTEX est focalisée sur le benzène, produit le plus toxique et le moins dégradable sur la plupart des sites. Les détails de la dégradation du benzène sur le terrain sont analysés dans la littérature et leur comparaison permet de décrire les mécanismes responsables de celle-ci. Dans le cas des solvants chlorés, l'attention est portée sur le TCE (Trichloréthylène), produit le plus couramment rencontré sur les sites pollués. Une mise en parallèle des évolutions de teneurs observées et des conditions chimiques locales permet de mettre en évidence les conditions nécessaires à la dégradation du TCE, et de ses congénères, ainsi que les cinétiques de dégradation dans différentes conditions. La mise en évidence du rôle prépondérant des conditions chimiques conduit à remettre en cause l'utilisation répandue des constantes de dégradation du premier ordre et donne des pistes pour les modèles nécessaires à une prédiction plus fine de l'atténuation naturelle. The increasing reliance on natural attenuation in dealing with contaminated sites in North America is the consequence of: 1. the extremely long duration and high cost of aquifer rehabilitation by classical methods, and 2. the discovery of natural biodegradation in many different situations. However, the use of this management technique is questionable, as intrinsic biodegradation is highly dependent on chemical conditions and particularly on redox equilibria. This paper describes the role of these chemical conditions on BTEX and chlorinated solvent attenuation and, by analyzing the current research, we try to define current limits of the predictability of natural attenuation in field conditions. Natural attenuation is defined as the sum of processes able to decrease the pollutant concentration at a sampling point in an aquifer. Several physical processes such as dispersion, retardation and solubility play a role in natural attenuation. However, only biodegradation can significantly reduce the overall amount of pollutants in an aquifer, thereby allowing the pollutant concentration to reach the low levels that are required by regulations. The physical processes cited above can be modelled at a site to account for their effect, but the main focus is on biodegradation. A detailed analysis of the basic thermodynamics of redox reactions involved in biodegradation is necessary to describe the reactions that can potentially occur. A rough analysis shows that BTEX is mainly degraded by oxidation and therefore is degraded more efficiently in aerobic media. However, toluene (and sometime ethylbenzene and xylene) can be degraded by fermentation and thus degradation occurs even in methanogenic conditions. In contrast, chlorinated solvents are degraded mainly by reduction, with the exception of c-DCE (cis-dichloroethylene) and VC (vinyl chloride), which are degraded by reduction and oxidation, thus having two degradative pathways. An overall comparison of reaction rates obtained from laboratory and field experiments clearly demonstrates that under field conditions the supply of redox reactants is a limiting factor in the reaction kinetics. Degradation of BTEX under field conditions has been widely documented, and toluene ethylbenzene and xylene degradation occurred in almost all chemical environments. The most persistent product observed in almost all the studies was benzene. Due to its persistence, and also its carcinogenic and toxic properties, we focussed on the results obtained for benzene. The kinetic constant for degradation of benzene under most field conditions ranged from almost no degradation in the reduced parts of the plume to fast degradation at the oxygenated border. Degradation under nitrate, methane or iron reducing conditions was almost insignificant, but degradation did occur under sulphate reducing conditions. A detailed analysis of the data on benzene degradation under sulphate reducing conditions showed that there is a competition between bacterial populations for electron acceptors. Benzene is degraded only if electron acceptors are in excess and if no other easily degradable carbon source is present. The analysis of experimental data on chlorinated solvents is more difficult because fewer studies exist and the degradation processes are slower and more complex. Significant intrinsic biodegradation occurs mainly by reductive dechlorination, with co-metabolism being important only under modified conditions. In the field, PCE (perchloroethylene) and TCE degradation occurred only under methanogenic and sulphate reducing conditions, while c-DCE was degraded in oxygenated media and finally VC degradation occurred under almost all redox potentials. The kinetics of degradation were slow, with half-lives in the order of 1 to several years. It was shown that the variability of such constants was quite high within the same site. This variability could be explained by the availability of reducing species, particularly hydrogen. By comparing the estimated and real length of solvent plumes it was shown that biodegradation was more important than transport for the sites with the most reducing conditions. At other sites, the necessity of both methanogenic conditions and a sufficient pool of electron donors in the aquifer was demonstrated. The high toxicity of VC, when compared to TCE, was of lower concern since it was shown that the plume size was equal to or smaller than that of TCE. This was due to a fast degradation kinetics for VC observed under aerobic conditions. In conclusion, the controversy surrounding the use of models based on first-order degradation constants arose because of the strong dependence of this constant on prevailing chemical conditions. If the target at risk is far away, use of the statistics on plume length existing for BTEX seems to be sufficient. However, when the benzene content is high and the target at risk is close, there is a need to predict the size of the reduced plume. The approach is the same for more substituted chlorinated solvents. The most important data, which are often missing, are the amount of total 'easily' degradable carbon (i.e. BTEX, short chain acids or alcohols) delivered by the source that will generate the reduced plume. In order to achieve a more precise prediction, models incorporating the whole redox chain need to be developed and tested against existing field data.\n",

      "Presentation OC5-1 A moderate ethanol load improves the hepatic insulinosensibility via the energetic metabolism in the isolated perfused rat liver studied by NMR Kassem C, Beauvieux MC, Roumes H, Couzigou P, Rigalleau V, Gin H, Gallis JL (France) Aims. In the isolated rat liver, the perfusion with a low dose of ethanol (EtOH), in absence of glucose and Ins, increases the phosphorylation rate and the yield of the oxidative phosphorylation (Beauvieux et al ., BBA 2002). On the other hand, we evidenced a linear and positive glucose-dependent correlation between the net fluxes of ATP and glycogen (Glg) only in presence of insulin; this result underlines that insulin (Ins) can control the Glg store via the energetic metabolism (Baillet-Blanco et al ., NutrandMetab 2005). Any change in this relationship in presence of a substrate could then indicate a variation in the insulinosensiblity. Since the effect of EtOH in the insulinoresistance is controversial, our aim is to evaluate the effect of EtOH 10 mM on the net fluxes of ATP and Glg in the liver. Methods. Male Wistar rats (100 g) were fed ad libitum . The livers ( n = 6 in each group) were isolated and perfused during 50 min (5 ml/min/g) with an isotonic buffer (37°C, O 2 95%, CO 2 5%) with 0, 6 or 30 mM glucose with or without Ins (120 mUI/l), with or without EtOH (10 mM). The changes in the ATP and Glg contents are followed by 31P and 13C NMR (Brucker DPX400, 9.4T). At t0, the ATP and Glg stores were 2.6+/−0.6 μmol/g ATP and 73+/−8 μmol glycosyl units/g, respectively; their changes (nmol·min −1 ) indicated net fluxes (Fn) which were the difference between the synthesis flux and the consumption one. Results. In presence of EtOH, the Fn(Glg) was negative whatever the glucose concentration, indicating a decrease in the glycogenosynthesis and/or an increase in the glycogenolysis. The addition of Ins induced a glucose-dependence of the Fn(Glg) and minimized the Fn magnitude. However the net Glg consumption was larger than those observed with Ins but without EtOH. On the other hand, the Ins perfusion (with or without EtOH) induced a glucose-dependence of the Fn(ATP) remaining negative in all cases; this net consumption of ATP was larger in presence of EtOH. Finally, a positive linear correlation (evidenced only in presence of Ins and glucose) was observed with EtOH perfusion [Fn(Glg) = 284.5 Fn(ATP)+2848] with a 4-fold larger slope than in absence of EtOH [Fn(Glg) = 72.5 Fn(ATP)+172]. Conclusions. The increase in the nutrient storage is one of the main properties of insulin. Although EtOH increases the net Glg consumption, the large improvement in the ATP supply (increased turn-over?) for the glycogenosynthesis led to the hypothesis that a moderate EtOH load improved the liver insulinosensibility. Presentation OC5-2 Overexpression of manganese superoxide dismutase triggers mitochondrial damage after chronic alcohol intoxication in mouse liver Larosche I, Lettéron P, Fromenty B, Bbey-Toby A, Vadrot N, Feldmann G, Van Remmen H, Richardson A, Pessayre D, Mansouri A (France) Aims. Long-term alcohol consumption causes morphologic and functional changes of liver mitochondria due to increased generation of reactive oxygen radicals. Overexpression of the mitochondrial isoform of superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) might therefore alleviate hepatic lesions mediated by oxidative stress, but controversies remain. Indeed, MnSOD overexpression in rats protects against alcohol-induced hepatic lesions whereas in humans, a genetic dimorphism increasing mitochondrial MnSOD activity is a risk factor to develop alcoholic liver diseases. The aim of the present study was therefore to determine whether overexpression of MnSOD affects mitochondrial damage in a mouse model of chronic ethanol exposure. Methods. Wild type MnSOD+/+ mice (WT) and overexpressing transgenic MnSOD+++ mice (TG) were fed ethanol for 7 weeks (20% in drinking water) and hepatic mitochondrial damage was evaluated. Results. Chronic ethanol feeding resulted in decreased hepatic mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) content and increased mtDNA damage in TG mice, whereas no alterations were observed in WT mice. Using Blue Native-PAGE method, we demonstrated that chronic alcohol consumption decreased the levels and activities of complexes I and V in TG mice compared to their respective littermates. Alcohol-induced inhibition of mitochondrial respiration may increase superoxide anion formation leading to an overproduction of hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 in TG mice. In combination with mobilization of iron caused by alcohol, H 2 O 2 may form the reactive hydroxyl radical (OH.). Hepatic iron was slightly but not significantly elevated in intoxicated TG mice but not in WT mice. Induction and/or inactivation of the antioxidant defense systems may further modulate mitochondrial damage in intoxicated mice. Cu, ZnSOD activity remained unchanged in intoxicated WT and TG mice whereas catalase activity decreased in TG mice fed alcohol. Mitochondrial GPx-1 activity and GSH were decreased in WT mice fed alcohol but not in TG mice, and MnSOD/GPx-1 ratio was increased in intoxicated TG mice, thus further increasing H 2 O 2 production. Furthermore, intoxicated TG mice showed an elevated content of carbonylated hepatic proteins, which may further impair respiratory chain function. Conclusions. Mice overexpressing MnSOD are more prone to mtDNA damage after a chronic alcohol exposure, resulting in impairment of mtDNA-encoded respiratory chain complexes thus leading to increased mitochondrial oxidative stress. Presentation OC5-3 Stabilization of IGFBP-1 mRNA by ethanol in hepatoma cells involves the JNK pathway Garlatti M, Magne L, Blanc E, Barouki R, Rouach H (France) Aims. Insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-1 (IGFBP-1) modulates cell growth and metabolism in a variety of physiopathological conditions. The aim of this study was to determine the molecular mechanisms involved in IGFBP-1 upregulation by ethanol. Methods. We studied IGFBP-1 regulation by ethanol at the protein, mRNA and gene promoter levels in the human hepatocarcinoma cell line, HepG2 which do not express significantly ethanol-metabolizing enzymes. Results. Ethanol (35 to 150 mM) induced the IGFBP-1 mRNA and protein up to 5-fold in a dose-dependent manner. A similar effect was observed using primary cultures of human hepatocytes. Various inhibitors of ethanol metabolism and the anti-oxidant N-acetylcysteine did not prevent ethanol effects. While ethanol did not modify the IGFBP-1 gene promoter activity, it elicited a 2- to 3-fold increase in IGFBP-1 mRNA half-life and this stabilization required the 5′ and the 3′ untranslated mRNA region. Ethanol triggered a rapid activation of Jun Kinase (JNK) in HepG2 cells and IGFBP-1 induction was significantly decreased by a specific inhibitor of JNK. Conclusions. This study reveals a novel pathway of gene regulation by alcohol which involves the activation of JNK and the consequent mRNA stabilization.\n",

      "LONDON.Royal Society, June 25.—D. H. Black: (3 ray spectra of thorium disintegration products. Using comparatively strong sources of thorium-B in equilibrium with thorium-C and thorium-D, the ray spectra of these substances have been re-measured in order to bring them into line with the standard spectrum of radium-B. Several new lines were found. Of these, one group is of great interest on account of the fact that, despite their high energy (2-5 million volts), they are due to the expulsion of electrons from the K, L, and M levels of. an atom by one 7 ray.-C. F. Elam: Tensile tests of crystals of an aluminium zinc alloy. The crystals, containing 18-6 per cent, zinc, resemble pure aluminium in structure and contain the zinc in “solid solution.” They are harder and less ductile than pure aluminium. Fracture occurs on one or more planes at approximately 45° to the axis. These planes are closely related to crystallographic planes. Slip planes are sometimes parallel to planes of fracture.-G. Shearer: On the distribution of intensity in the X-ray spectra of certain long-chain organic compounds. In the X-ray \"spectra \"of substances the molecules of which contain long open chains of carbon atoms, there is a certain large spacing corresponding to planes at distances apart closely related to the length of a single molecule or of two, end to end. A large number of successive orders of reflection from this plane can be observed, and their distribution of intensity is calculated on certain simple assumptions as to the distribution of scattering material along the length of the molecule. It is thus possible, to fix with reasonable accuracy the position in the chain of the CO group in such series as the ketones and the esters; this appears to open up a new application of X-ray methods to chemical analysis. Further work on these lines may throw light on the relative scattering power of the various atoms and atomic groups.--C. F. Jenkin: High-frequency fatigue tests. High-frequency fatigue tests on copper, Armco iron, and mild steel were obtained at frequencies so high as 2000 periods per second, and unsuccessful experiments were made up to 5000 periods per second. There is a small rise in the fatigue limit as the speed is increased. The dependence of the fatigue limit on the frequency has, however, an important bearing on the theory of fatigue failure. The term \"fatigue limit \"is used here to denote the greatest alternating stress which can be applied to a material for an indefinitely large number of periods without causing fracture.-L. W. Bryant and D. H. Williams: An investigation of the flow of air around an aerofoil of infinite span. The stream-lines deduced were compared with those for inviscid flow obtained by means of an electric tank in which the equipotential lines were equivalent to stream - lines in a perfect fluid. Except for a narrow trailing \"wake,\"the lines of viscous flow approximate to those for an inviscid fluid, when a circulation equal to- that experimentally determined in the wind tunnel is superposed upon the flow around the aerofoil without circulation. The boundary layer around the nose and over the under surface of the aerofoil is very thin. Velocities deduced from observed pressures on the surface agree very well with velocities measured in the free stream, except over the upper surface, where \"wake \"begins to develop.-G. I. Taylor: Note on the connexion between the lift of an aerofoil in a wind and the circulation round it (Appendix to preceding paper). The connexion between the lift force on an aerofoil and the circulation round it is independent of the contour chosen if the flow is irrotational, and also if the flow is not irrotational provided that a special type of contour is used, according to Messrs. Bryant and Williams. Their contours happen to be of the special type, so the accuracy with which the observed lift force agrees with that predicted from measurements of circulation is no indication that the flow is in fact an irrotational motion with circulation.-T. H. Havelock: Wave resistance: the effect of varying draught. The effect of finite draught is considered; in particular, calculations are made when the ratio of draught to length is one-twentieth and one-tenth, a range which covers approximately ship models.

Part III.-W. H. George: An electrical method for the study of impact applied to the struck string. The two impinging bodies close, during the impact, a simple electrical circuit which includes an oscillograph. From the current variations shown in the oscillograph record, the variations in mechanical pressure during the impact is derived. With a struck string there are important fluctuations in the pressure between the hammer and string, depending markedly upon the position of the striking point along the string. At some places there is a momentary complete separation of hammer and string; These results are inconsistent with the older theories of the struck string, but are consistent with the newer theories. The ballistic galvanometer method to determine the duration of the impact upon the struck string is, in general, invalid.-F. H. Constable: The mechanism of catalytic decomposition. A quantitative theory based upon the series of papers entitled \"The Catalytic Action of Copper\"(Proc. Roy. Soc., A, vols. 98 to 107) is developed. The dehydrogenation of alcoholic substances by copper occurs in stages. Reaction only occurs in a unimolecular layer in which the - CH2OH groups are in contact with the copper surface. Activation of the alcohol molecule by the catalyst consists in increasing the distance between the H atom and the O atom in the hydroxyl group. Quantitative treatment from this point of view leads to results which are not in accord with experiment. Application of the theory of probability to the conception of a \"reaction centre \"enables the number of centres present to be connected with the heat of activation of each by an exponential relation. The equation obtained is in accord with experience in so far as it can be tested.-rS. A. Emerson and L. C. Martin: The photometric matching field.-II. Peripheral stimulation of the retina with white light may cause a reduction in the limen of contrast perception at the fovea. With monochromatic lights, using the same wave-length in centre and surround, initial reductions followed by a rise in the limen are found with 'increasing brightness of surround at all wavelengths, but the reductions are small in the red as compared with the blue end of the spectrum. The effects may be partly due to reflex actions associated with the retinal rods.-G. S. Adair: Partial osmotic pressures and membrane equilibria. Methods for calculating partial pressures are described, based on a long unrecognised equation for membrane equilibrium, developed by Gibbs. The.modified form of Dalton's law applies to certain haemoglobin solutions over a wide range of concentrations, not necessarily restricted to the very short range where the pressure is proportional to the concentration. The partial osmotic pressure of haemoglobin is relat d to the concentration by a form of Van der Waals' equation.- Mary W, Porter: A contribution to the study of the optical properties of mixed crystals.

Matthai: Colony formation in astraeid corals (I.). Royal Anthropological Institute, May 19.-R. Ruggles Gates: Mendelian inheritance in man. Many abnormalities in man are inherited as simple Mendelian differences, and this is to be expected, since they must have arisen as single mutations. Such are brachydactyly and many other digital abnormalities, which are usually inherited as dominant characters. There is evidence that even slight abnormalities may sometimes be lethal in their effects when present in the homozygous condition. Cataract is usually inherited as a dominant, while such conditions as albinism and alkaptonuria are recessives. Colourblindness, haemophilia and some other conditions are usually sex-linked in inheritance, their history following exactly the course from generation to generation taken by the sex chromosomes. But various exceptions are found; and the same character may be differently inherited in different families, according to which part of the germ plasm was originally altered. The cephalic index has long been regarded as an important racial character. Recent investigations of Frets, Hild6n, and others lead to the view that multiple, cumulative size factors are involved and that brachycephaly in general is dominant over dolichocephaly. Age, sex, nutrition, stature and climate affect the head form. Interracial crosses appear frequently to give 2-peaked curves for cephalic index in later generations. Records of crosses between Indians and whites, obtained in Northern Ontario, indicate that skin-colour segregates and that eye-colour is inherited independently of skin-colour. PARIS.

      "LONDON. Royal Society, May 7.—M. D. Waller: (1.) The measurement of actinic erythema produced by ultraviolet radiation with special reference to the latent time. Consistent results regarding the biological action of ultra-violet radiation, as measured by the resulting skin erythema, can be obtained provided certain precautions are taken. The latent time of erythema, which may vary from about one to seven hours, according to the length of exposure, provides the most accurate and simple way of estimating the effect of ultra-violet radiation on the skin, and it is easily measured. When it is desired to get the maximum contrasts due to differing conditions of radiation, exposures should be chosen which will lie on the steep part of the curve, corresponding to rapid variations of the latent time with exposure and to slight erythemas which will differ even visually one from another more than will deep erythemas.—(2.) The relation between energy doses of ultra-violet radiation and actinic erythema produced. Particular attention was paid to the question of how the intensity of the radiation decreases with the distance from the source. The intensities were varied over wide limits (200: 1) corresponding to distances varying from 40 cm. to 5-5 m. The effect of a given dose of the weak intensity is just as great as that of the most powerful intensity used, and it is concluded that the production of erythema follows the Bunsen-Roscoe law for a photo-chemical action, that is, the time factor is unity.—J. W. Tudor Thomas: On the return of sensitiveness in corneal grafts in rabbits. In a series of experiments on corneal grafting, some of the grafts became sensitive and others did not. The results of 29 experiments are analysed. Some of the grafts were central in position in the cornea, others marginal. Some remained or became clear; others became more or less opaque, while one exhibited a central clear area. The establishment of an afferent nerve supply to a corneal graft depends upon a precedent or concurrent growth of blood vessels in that graft. It does not seem to be necessary that the blood vessels should accompany or take the same path as the afferent nerves that grow in from the surrounding tissue.—G. E. Briggs and A. H. K. Petrie: Respiration as a factor in the ionic equilibria between plant tissues and external solutions. The conductivity of water containing slices of tissue from carrot root rises at first and then falls to a steady value, which is maintained as long as the tissue is alive. The rate of evolution of carbon dioxide by the system follows a similar course to that of the conductivity. Theoretical consideration shows that variations in the rate of production of carbon dioxide by the tissue will be accompanied by similar changes in the concentration of hydrogen ions in the tissue. This will result in changes in the degree of ionisation of indiffusible substances, such as proteins, with consequent changes in the distribution of diffusible ions, such as K and Cl, between the tissue and the external solution. The final result of this chain of events will be a parallelism between rate of production of carbon dioxide and conductivity of external solution.—McKeen Cattell, T. P. Feng, W. Hartree, A. V. Hill, and J. L. Parkinson: Recovery heat in muscular contraction without lactic acid formation. Muscles poisoned with iodo-acetic acid contract without producing lactic acid. Functional recovery in oxygen after stimulation can be demonstrated under certain conditions in such muscles. The persistence of this ‘recovery’ heat suggests that one effect of iodo-acetic acid is to interfere with the mechanism by which energy released in oxidation can be employed in driving the endothermic reactions necessary for functional recovery; it does not interfere with oxidation as such. Normal muscles stimulated to extreme exhaustion have a ‘recovery’ heat only about one quarter of its usual value in relation to the initial heat. Possibly in normal muscles pushed to extreme exhaustion, as in muscles poisoned with iodo-acetic acid, one reason of incomplete recovery is that phosphate set free by the breakdown of creatine-phosphoric acid is ‘side-tracked’ as hexose phosphoric ester and so cannot be recombined with creatine. A. G. R. Whitehouse: Further investigation of sweating and sweat. For a given rise in body temperature, sweating is facilitated by the performance of muscular work when compared with sweating produced by the same rise in body temperature with the subject at rest. Some product of muscular metabolism is responsible for this, though the connexion may be a less direct one. The performance of a moderate amount of work would seem to be accompanied by little rise in the chlorine concentration of the sweat, although a marked increase with time, indicative of fatigue of the sweat-glands, is evident when the subject is at rest and the sweating is simply due to the wet-bulb temperature of the surrounding air. A progressive decrease in the proportion of organic matter to ash is observed as the sweating continues. The chlorine concentration, and also the ratio of chlorine to potassium in the sweat, is found to vary for different individuals.—R. Snow: Experiments on growth and inhibition (2). In decapitated pea seedlings, which have produced two equal shoots springing from the axils of the cotyledons, if one of the shoots is deprived of its leaves until only those of 1 mm. or less remain, it is rapidly arrested in growth and finally killed. This effect must be due to inhibition coming from the other shoot. The influence coming from developing leaves kills (directly or indirectly) those shoots or parts of shoots that are not in the line between developing leaves and roots and in which it travels towards the apex, and this fact also suggests that it is of a polar nature.\n",

      "Introduction: There are numerous methods of isolating and detecting organisms that are similar and closely related; one of the most reliable method is molecular typing of 16S rRNA. Apart from being omnipresent as a multigene family, or operons; it is evolutionarily stable; the 16S rRNA gene (1,500 bp) is large enough for informatics purposes.  Materials and Method: This study employed molecular sequencing of 16S rRNA by Sanger method to reveal the specific organisms’ nucleotides and blasting (BLASTn) to show the similarities between the resulting organisms and existing organisms. The 16S rRNA remains the best choice of identification process for bacteria because of its distinguishing sizes and evolutionary stability.  Results: All isolates were Gram positive rods and were positive in Biochemical tests such as oxidase, catalase, citrate, and protease but were in turn negative in coagulase and indole test tests. On sensitivity test; 80% of all the isolates were resistant to common antibiotics except ciprofloxacin and ceftriaxone. Based on the sequence difference in the variable region (V1) of 16S rRNA as observed from the molecular sequencing results; four isolates out of ten were identified. Six were different strains of B cereus. Others isolates include: wiedmannii, thuringensis, toyonensis and pseudomycoides. Sequence analysis of the primer annealing sites showed that there is no clear‐cut difference in the   conserved region of 16S rRNA, and in the gyrB gene, between B. cereus and B. thuringiensis strains. Phylogenetic analysis showed that four isolates showed high similarity to each other; hence the limited number of deletions when subjected to alignments by maximum neighborhood joining parsimony using MEGA X software.  B. toyonensis, B. wiedmannii and thuringensis were distantly related.  Introduction  Authors Pathogens cause illness and death in some countries and it also causes infections and gastrointestinal diseases in other countries thereby causing public health concern. Pathogens are organisms capable of causing diseases. Reliable methods are needed for the detection of pathogens due to pathogen evolution as a result of new human habits or new industrial practices.     Microbial classification of organisms ranges from genus to specie level depending upon the technique used either phenotypic or genotypic. Presently, molecular methods now obtain advances to allow utilization in microbiology [1]. There are numerous molecular methods which are of fast and simple application to the detection of pathogen. Among the pathogens involved in human health, Bacillus cereus is interesting due to their ability to survive in various habitats [2].  The genus Bacillus is aerobic or facultative anaerobic bacteria, gram positive spore forming rod shaped bacteria. Which can be characterized by two morphological forms, the vegetative cell which range from 1.02 to 1.2 um in width and from 3.0 to 5.0 in length, it can be straight or slightly curve, motile or non-motile, and the endospore (the non-swelling sporangium). The genus Bacillus is been characterized by the presence of endospore, which is not more than one per cell and they are resistant to many adverse environmental conditions such as heat, radiation, cold and disinfectants. It can also respire either in the presence or absence of oxygen [3]. Cell diameter of Bacillus cereus, sporangium and catalase test do not allow differentiation, where as important in differentiation among B. anthracis, B. cereus, B. thuringiensis can be considered by parasporal crystals and the presence of capsule. [4] Showed a B. thuringiensis strain capable of producing a capsule resembling that of B. anthracis. Most species of the genus display a great kind in physiological characteristics such as degradation of cellulose, starch, pectin, agar, hydrocarbons, production of enzymes and antibiotics and other characteristic such as acidophile, alkalinophile, psychrophile, and thermophile's which allows them to adapt to various environmental conditions [5]. In differentiating between species of the genus Bacillus it was difficult at early attempts when endospore formation and aerobic respiration were the main character used for classification. As reported by many authors that at molecular method level, the differentiation between B. thuringiensis and B. cereus is also very difficult.    cereus can survive at the temperature between 4°c and 55°c. The mesophile strains can grow between the temperature of 10°c and 42°c, while psychotropic strains can survive at 4°c, whereas other strains are able to grow at 52 to 55°c. B. cereus vegetative cells grow at pH between 1.0 and 5.2. Heat resistant strain can survive and multiply in wet low acid foods in temperature ranging from 5 to 52°c. The survivability of B. cereus spores at 95°c decreases when the pH level decreases from 6.2 to 4.7 [6]. B. cereus can grow in the presence of salt with concentration up to 7.5% depending on the pH value.  thuringiensis possesses a protein crystal that is toxic to insects. This toxin protein was first known as parasporal crystalline inclusion but was later referred to as π - endotoxin or in other ways known as insecticidal crystal protein [7]. Strains of B. thuringiensis bacteria possess a wide range of specificity in various orders of insects such as Lepidoptera, dipteral, coleoptera. These strains of bacteria produce crystalline proteins known as cry protein during sporulation. When B. thuringiensis infects an insects, it will cause the insect to loose appetite, enhances slow movement and over time the insect will die due to crystals of proteins that have been dissolved in the insect's stomach.    In the cultivation of vegetable crops, the plant can be attack by many types of pests. Hence, in overcoming pest attacks farmers often use pesticides that contain active synthetic materials. Many negative effects arise from the folly use of chemical pesticides. Among the negative effect is the increase of pest population, resistance, death of natural enemy population and increase in residue level on Agricultural product which makes it unsafe for public consumption [8]. Therefore, it is necessary to find an alternative method in the control of crop pest. The best alternative that can be done is to replace the chemical insecticide with biological control which involves the use of living things in the form of microorganisms. In these profiling microbial communities, the main objective is to identify which bacteria and how much they are present in the environments. Most microbial profiling methods focus on the identification and quantification of bacteria with already sequenced genomes. Further, most methods utilize information obtained from entire genomes. Homology-based methods such as [1–4] classify sequences by detecting homology in reads belonging to either an entire genome or only a small set of marker genes. Composition-based methods generally use conserved compositional features of genomes for classification and as such they utilize less computational resources.Using the 16S rRNA gene instead of whole genome information is not only computational efficient but also economical; Illumina indicated that targeted sequencing of a focused region of interest reduces sequencing costs and enables deep sequencing, compared to whole-genome sequencing. On the other hand, as observed by [8], by focusing exclusively on one gene, one might lose essential information for advanced analyses. We, however, will provide an analysis that demonstrates that at least in the context of oral microbial communities, the 16S rRNA gene retains sufficient information to allow us detect unknown bacteria  [9, 10]. This study aimed at employing 16S rRNA as an instrument of identification of seemingly close Bacillus species.  Abbreviations  BLAST, Basic Local Alignment sequence Tools; PCR, Polymerase Chains reactions; rRNA, ribosomal RNA;  Material and methods  T Sample collection. Soil samples were collected from three sources from Rice, Sugar Cane, vegetables and abandoned farmland in January 2019. The samples were labeled serially from  Sample 1 to Sample 10 (S1 to S10).   Bacterial culture: A serial dilution of 10 folds was performed. Bacterial suspension was diluted (10-10) with saline water and 100 μl of bacterial suspension werespread on Nutrient Agar plate and incubated for 24 hours. Bacterial colonies were isolated and grown in Nutrient Broth and nutrient agar. Other microbiological solid agar used include: Chocolate, Blood Agar, EMB, MacConkey, Simon citrate, MRS Agar.  Bacteria were characterized by conventional technique by the use of morphological appearance and performance on biochemical analysis [11].  Identification of bacteria:The identification of bacteria was based on morphological characteristics and biochemical tests carried out on the isolates. Morphological characteristics observed for each bacteria colony after 24 h of growth included colony appearance; cell shape, color, optical characteristics, consistency, colonial appearance and pigmentation. Biochemical characterizations were performed according to the method of [12]  Catalase test: A small quantity of 24 h old culture was transferred into a drop of 3% Hydrogen peroxide solution on a clean slide with the aid of sterile inoculating loop. Gas seen as white froth indicates the presence of catalase enzyme [13] on the isolates.  DNA Extraction Processes  The extraction processes was in four phase which are:  Collection of cell, lyses of cell, Collection of DNA by phenol, Concentration and purification of DNA.  Collection of cell: the pure colonyof the bacteria culture was inoculated into a prepared sterile nutrient broth. After growth is confirmed by the turbidity of the culture, 1.5ml of the culture was taken into a centrifuge tube and was centrifuge at 5000 rpm for 5 minutes; the supernatant layer was discarded leaving the sediment.  Lyses of cell: 400 microns of lyses buffer is added to the sediment and was mixed thoroughly and allow to stand for five minutes at room temperature (25°c). 200 microns of Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate (SDS) solution was added for protein lyses and was mixed gently and incubated at 65°c for 10 minutes.  Collection of DNA by phenol; 500 microns of phenol chloroform was added to the solution for the separation of DNA, it was mixed completely and centrifuge at 10,000 rpm for 10 minutes. The white pallet seen at the top of the tube after centrifugation is separated into another sterile tube and 1micron of Isopropanol is added and incubated for 1hour at -20°c for precipitation of DNA. The DNA is seen as a colorless liquid in the solution.  Concentration and purification of DNA: the solution was centrifuge at 10,000 rpm for 10 minutes. The supernatant layer was discarded and the remaining DNA pellets was washed with 1micron of 17% ethanol, mixed and centrifuge at 10,000 rpm for 10 minutes. The supernatant layer was discarded and air dried. 60 micron TE. Buffer was added for further dissolving of the DNA which was later stored at -40°c until it was required for use [14].  PCR Amplification   This requires the use of primers (Forward and Reverse), polymerase enzyme, a template DNA and the d pieces which includedddATP, ddGTP and ddTTP, ddNTP. All this are called the master mix.    The PCR reactions consist of three main cycles.  The DNA sample was heated at 940c to separate the two template of the DNA strand which was bonded by a hydrogen bond. Once both strand are separated the temperature is reduced to 570c (Annealing temperature). This temperature allows the binding of the forward and reverse primers to the template DNA. After binding the temperature is raised back to 720c which leads to the activation of polymerase enzyme and its start adding d NTPs to the DNA leading to the synthesize of new strands. The cycles were repeated several times in order to obtain millions of the copies of the target DNA [15].  Preparation of Agarose Gel  One gram (1 g) of agarose for DNA was measured or 2 g of agarose powdered will be measured for PCR analysis. This done by mixing the agarose powder with 100 ml 1×TAE in a microwaveable flask and microwaved for 1-3 minutes until the agarose is completely dissolved (do not over boil the solution as some of the buffer will evaporate) and thus alter the final percentage of the agarose in the gel. Allow the agarose solution to cool down to about 50°c then after five minutes   10µL was added to EZ vision DNA stain. EZ vision binds to the DNA and allows one to easily visualize the DNA under ultra violet (UV) light. The agarose was poured into the gel tray with the well comb firmly in place and this was placed in newly poured gel at 4°c for 10-15 mins or it sit at room temperature for 20-30 mins, until it has completely solidified[16].  Loading and Running of samples on Agarose gel  The agarose gel was placed into the chamber, and the process of electrophoresis commenced with running buffer introduced into the reservoir at the end of the chamber until it the buffer covered at least 2millimeter of the gel. It is advisable to place samples to be loaded in the correct order according to the lanes they are assigned to be running. When loading the samples keep the pipette tip perpendicular to the row of the wells as by supporting your accustomed hand with the second hand; this will reduce the risk of accidentally puncturing the wells with the tip. Lower the tip of the pipette until it breaks the surface of the buffer and is located just above the well. Once all the samples have been loaded it is advised to always avoid any movement of the gel chamber. This might result in the sample spilling into adjacent well. Place the lid on the gel chamber with the terminal correctly positioned to the matching electrodes on the gel chamber black to black and red to red. Remember that DNA is negatively charged hence the movement of the electric current from negatively charged to the positively charged depending on the bandwidth in Kilobytes. Once the electrode is connected to the power supply, switch ON the power supply then set the correct constant voltage (100) and stopwatch for proper time. Press the start button to begin the flow of current that will separate the DNA fragment.After few minutes the samples begins to migrate from the wells into the gel. As the DNA runs, the diaphragm moves from the negative electrode towards the positive electrode [17].  PCR mix Components and Sanger Sequencing  This is made up of primers which is both Forward and Reverse, the polymerase enzyme (Taq), a template DNA and the pieces of nucleotides which include: ddNTP, ddATP, ddGTP and ddTTP. Note that the specific Primer’s sequences for bacterial identification is: 785F 5' (GGA TTA GAT ACC CTG GTA) 3', 27F 5' (AGA GTT TGA TCM TGG CTC AG) 3', 907R 5' (CCG TCA ATT CMT TTR AGT TT) 3', 1492R 5' (TAC GGY TAC CTT GTT ACG ACT T) 3' in Sanger Sequencing techniques.  BLAST  The resulting genomic sequence were assembled and submitted in GenBank at NCBI for assignment of accession numbers. The resultant assertion numbers were subjected to homology search by using Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) as NCBI with the assertion number MW362290, MW362291, MW362292, MW362293, MW362294 and MW362295 respectively. Whereas, the other isolates’ accession numbers were retrieved from NCBI GenBank which are:AB 738796.1, JH792136.1, MW 015768.1 and MG745385.1.MEGA 5.2 software was used for the construction of phylogenetic tree and phylogenetic analysis.  All the organisms possess 100% identities, 0% gaps and 0.0% E.value which indicated that the organisms are closely related to the existing organisms. The use of 16S rRNA is the best identification process for bacteria because 16S rRNA gene has a distinguishing size of about 500 bases until 1500bp. Rather than using 23S rRNA which is of higher variation, The 16S rRNA is adopted in prokaryotes. 18S rRNA is used for identification in Eukaryotes  Results  The results of both the conventional morphological and cultural identification was correlated with the molecular sequencing results. Six isolates were confirmed B. cereus species while the other four isolates were. B. wiedmannii, B. thuringiensis, B. toyonensis and B. pseudomycoides.The 16S rRNA sequence of six isolates MW 362290.1- MW362295.1 were assigned accession numbers and deposited in the GenBank while the other four sequences were aligned to those available in the NCBI database. The alignment results showed closely relatedness to LT844650.1with an identity of 100% to 92.2% as above. The six isolates of Bacillus cereus great evolutionary relatedness as shown in the phylogenetic tree constructed using MEGA X software.

The six isolates of Bacillus cereus great evolutionary relatedness as shown in the phylogenetic treeconstructed using MEGA X software.  Discussion  The results obtained in this study is consistent with the previous studies in other countries22,23 The results of the phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA isolate of in this study was similar to the housekeeping genes proposed by [18, 19]. In comparing this study with the earlier study, B. cereus group comprising other species of Bacillus was hypothesized to be considered to form a single species with different ecotypes and pathotype. This study was able to phenotypically differentiated B. thuringiensis, B. pseudomycoides, B. toyonensis, B. wiedmannii and B. cereus sensu strito. Despite differences at the colonial appearance level, the 16S rRNA sequences have homology ranging from 100% to 92% providing insufficient resolution at the species level [6, 7, 18].After analysis through various methods, the strain was identified as Gram-positive bacteria of Bacillus cereus with a homology of 99.4%. Cohan [20] demonstrated that 95–99% of the similarity of 16S rRNA gene sequence between two bacteria hints towards a similar species while >99% indicates the same bacteria.The phylogenetic tree showed that B. toyonensis, B. thuringiensis and B. wiedmanniiare the outgroups of B. cereus  group while B. pseudomycoides are most closely related to B. cereus group [19, 21, 22].  Conclusion  In the area of molecular epidemiology, genotypic typing method has greatly increased our ability to differentiate between micro-organisms at the intra and interspecies levels and have become an essential and powerful tool. Phenotypic method will still remain important in diagnostic microbiology and genotypic method will become increasingly popular.  After analysis through various methods, the strain was identified as Gram-positive bacteria of Bacillus cereus with a homology of between 100% and 92.3%.

      "Every crisis at the same time reveals, forewarns and implies changes with cyclical trends that can be analyzed from different disciplinary perspectives, building scenarios to anticipate the future, despite uncertainties and risks. And the current crisis certainly appears as one of the most problematic of the modern era: recently, Luigi Ferrara, Director of the School of Design at the George Brown College in Toronto and of the connected Institute without Boundaries, highlighted how the pandemic has simply accelerated undergoing dynamics, exacerbating other crises – climatic, environmental, social, economic – which had already been going on for a long time both locally and globally. In the most economically developed contexts, from North America to Europe, the Covid emergency has led, for example, to the closure of almost 30% of the retail trade, as well as to the disposal and sale of many churches. Places of care and assistance, such as hospitals and elderly houses, have become places of death and isolation for over a year, or have been closed. At the same time, the pandemic has imposed the revolution of the remote working and education, which was heralded – without much success – more than twenty years ago. In these even contradictory dynamics, Ferrara sees many possibilities: new roles for stronger and more capable public institutions as well as the opportunity to rethink and redesign the built environment and the landscape. Last but not least, against a future that could be configured as dystopian, a unique chance to enable forms of citizenship and communities capable of inhabiting more sustainable, intelligent and ethical cities and territories; and architects capable of designing them. This multifactorial and pervasive crisis seems therefore to impose a deep review of the current unequal development models, in the perspective of that “creative destruction” that Schumpeter placed at the basis of the dynamic entrepreneurial push: «To produce means to combine materials and forces within our reach. To produce other things, or the same things by a different method, means to combine these materials and forces differently» (Schumpeter, 1912). A concept well suiting to the design practice as a response to social needs and improving the living conditions. This is the perspective of Architectural Technology, in its various forms, which has always placed the experimental method at the center of its action. As Eduardo Vittoria already pointed out: «The specific contribution of the technological project to the development of an industrial culture is aimed at balancing the emotional-aesthetic data of the design with the technical-productive data of the industry. Design becomes a place of convergence of ideas and skills related to factuality, based on a multidisciplinary intelligence» (Vittoria, 1999). A lucid and appropriate critique of the many formalistic emphases that have invested contemporary architecture. In the most acute phases of the pandemic, the radical nature of this polycrisis has been repeatedly invoked as a lever for an equally radical modification of the development models, for the definitive defeat of conjunctural and emergency modes of action. With particular reference to the Italian context, however, it seems improper to talk about a “change of models” – whether economic, social, productive or programming, rather than technological innovation – since in the national reality the models and reference systems prove to not to be actually structured. The current socio-economic and productive framework, and the political and planning actions themselves, are rather a variegated and disordered set of consolidated practices, habits often distorted when not deleterious, that correspond to stratified regulatory apparatuses, which are inconsistent and often ineffective. It is even more difficult to talk about programmatic rationality models in the specific sector of construction and built environment transformation, where the enunciation of objectives and the prospection of planning actions rarely achieve adequate projects and certain implementation processes, verified for the consistency of the results obtained and monitored for the ability in maintaining the required performance over time. Rather than “changing the model”, in the Italian case, we should therefore talk about giving shape and implementation to an organic and rational system of multilevel and inter-sectorial governance models, which assumes the principles of subsidiarity, administrative decentralization, inter-institutional and public-private cooperation. But, even in the current situation, with the pandemic not yet over, we are already experiencing a sort of “return to order”: after having envisaged radical changes – new urban models environmentally and climatically more sustainable, residential systems and public spaces more responsive to the pressing needs of social demand, priority actions to redevelop the suburbs and to strength infrastructures and ecosystem services, new advanced forms of decision-making decentralization for the co-planning of urban and territorial transformations, and so on – everything seems to has been reset to zero. This is evident from the list of actions and projects proposed by the National Recovery and Resilience Plan (NRRP), where no clear national strategy for green transition emerges, even though it is repeatedly mentioned. As highlighted by the Coordination of Technical-Scientific Associations for the Environment and Landscape1, and as required by EU guidelines2, this transition requires a paradigm shift that assumes eco-sustainability as a transversal guideline for all actions. With the primary objective of protecting ecosystem balances, improving and enhancing the natural and landscape capital, as well as protecting citizen health and well-being from environmental risks and from those generated by improper anthropization phenomena. The contents of the Plan explicitly emphases the need to «repair the economic and social damage of the pandemic crisis» and to «contribute to addressing the structural weaknesses of the Italian economy», two certainly relevant objectives, the pursuit of which, however, could paradoxically contrast precisely with the transition to a more sustainable development. In the Plan, the green revolution and the ecological transition are resolved in a dedicated axis (waste management, hydrogen, energy efficiency of buildings, without however specific reform guidelines of the broader “energy” sector), while «only one of the projects of the Plan regards directly the theme Biodiversity / Ecosystem / Landscape, and in a completely marginal way» (CATAP, 2021). Actions are also limited for assessing the environmental sustainability of the interventions, except the provision of an ad hoc Commission for the streamlining of some procedural steps and a generic indication of compliance with the DNSH-Do not significant Harm criterion (do not cause any significant damage), without specific guidelines on the evaluation methods. Moreover, little or nothing in the Plan refers on actions and investments in urban renewal, abandoned heritage recovery3, of in protecting and enhancing areas characterized by environmental sensitivity/fragility; situations widely present on the national territory, which are instead the first resource for a structural environmental transition. Finally yet importantly, the well-known inability to manage expenditure and the public administration inefficiencies must be considered: a limit not only to the effective implementation of projects, but also to the control of the relationship between time, costs and quality (also environmental) of the interventions. In many places, the Plan has been talked about as an opportunity for a real “reconstruction”, similar to that of post-war Italy; forgetting that the socio-economic renaissance was driven by the INA-Casa Plan4, but also by a considerable robustness of the cultural approach in the research and experimentation of new housing models (Schiaffonati, 2014)5. A possible “model”, which – appropriately updated in socio-technical and environmental terms – could be a reference for an incisive governmental action aiming at answering to a question – the one of the housing – far from being resolved and still a priority, if not an emergency. The crisis also implies the deployment of new skills, with a review of outdated disciplinary approaches, abandoning all corporate resistances and subcultures that have long prevented the change. A particularly deep fracture in our country, which has implications in research, education and professions, dramatically evident in the disciplines of architectural and urban design. Coherently with the EU Strategic Agenda 2019-2024 and the European Pillar of Social Rights, the action plan presented by the Commission in March 2021, with the commitment of the Declaration of Porto on May 7, sets three main objectives for 2030: an employment rate higher than 78%, the participation of more than 60% of adults in training courses every year and at least 15 million fewer people at risk of social exclusion or poverty6. Education, training and retraining, lifelong learning and employment-oriented skills, placed at the center of EU policy action, now require large investments, to stimulate employment transitions towards the emerging sectors of green, circular and digital economies (environmental design and assessment, risk assessment & management, safety, durability and maintainability, design and management of the life cycle of plans, projects, building systems and components: contents that are completely marginal or absent in the current training offer of Architecture). Departments and PhDs in the Technological Area have actively worked with considerable effectiveness in this field. In these regards, we have to recall the role played by Romano Del Nord «protagonist for commitment and clarity in identifying fundamental strategic lines for the cultural and professional training of architects, in the face of unprecedented changes of the environmental and production context» (Schiaffonati, 2021). Today, on the other hand, the axis of permanent and technical training is almost forgotten by ministerial and university policies for the reorganization of teaching systems, with a lack of strategic visions for bridging the deficit of skills that characterizes the area of architecture on the facing environmental and socio-economic challenges. Also and precisely in the dual perspective of greater interaction with the research systems and with the world of companies and institutions, and of that trans- and multi-disciplinary dimension of knowledge, methods and techniques necessary for the ecological transition of settlement systems and construction sector. Due to the high awareness of the Technological Area about the multifactorial and multi-scale dimension of the crises that recurrently affect our territories, SITdA has been configured since its foundation as a place for scientific and cultural debate on the research and training themes. With a critical approach to the consoling academic attitude looking for a “specific disciplinary” external and extraneous to the social production of goods and services. Finalizing the action of our community to «activate relationships between universities, professions, institutions through the promotion of the technological culture of architecture [...], to offer scientific-cultural resources for the training and qualification of young researchers [...], in collaboration with the national education system in order to advance training in the areas of technology and innovation in architecture» (SITdA Statute, 2007). Goals and topics which seem to be current, which Techne intends to resume and develop in the next issues, and already widely present in this n. 22 dedicated to the Circular Economy. A theme that, as emerges from the contributions, permeates the entire field of action of the project: housing, services, public space, suburbs, infrastructures, production, buildings. All contexts in which technological innovation invests both processes and products: artificial intelligence, robotics and automation, internet of things, 3D printing, sensors, nano and biotechnology, biomaterials, biogenetics and neuroscience feed advanced experiments that cross-fertilize different contributions towards common objectives of circularity and sustainability. In this context, the issue of waste, the superfluous, abandonment and waste, emerge, raising the question of re-purpose: an action that crosses a large panel of cases, due to the presence of a vast heritage of resources – materials, artefacts, spaces and entire territories – to be recovered and re-functionalized, transforming, adapting, reusing, reconverting, reactivating the existing for new purposes and uses, or adapting it to new and changing needs. Therefore, by adopting strategies and techniques of reconversion and reuse, of re-manufacturing and recycling of construction and demolition waste, of design for disassembly that operate along even unprecedented supply chains and which are accompanied by actions to extend the useful life cycle of materials , components and building systems, as well as product service logic also extended to durable goods such as the housing. These are complex perspectives but considerably interesting, feasible through the activation of adequate and updated skills systems, for a necessary and possible future, precisely starting from the ability – as designers, researchers and teachers in the area of Architectural Technology – to read the space and conceive a project within a system of rationalities, albeit limited, but substantially founded, which qualify the interventions through approaches validated in research and experimental verification. Contrarily to any ineffective academicism, which corresponds in fact to a condition of subordination caused by the hegemonic dynamics at the base of the crisis itself, but also by a loss of authority that derives from the inadequate preparation of the architects. An expropriation that legitimizes the worst ignorance in the government of the territories, cities and artifacts. Education in Architecture, strictly connected to the research from which contents and methods derive, has its central pivot in the project didactic: activity by its nature of a practical and experimental type, applied to specific places and contexts, concrete and material, and characterized by considerable complexity, due to the multiplicity of factors involved. This is what differentiates the construction sector, delegated to territorial and urban transformations, from any other sector. A sector that borrows its knowledge from other production processes, importing technologies and materials. With a complex integration of which the project is charged, for the realization of the buildings, along a succession of phases for corresponding to multiple regulatory and procedural constraints. The knowledge and rationalization of these processes are the basis of the evolution of the design and construction production approaches, as well as merely intuitive logics. These aspects were the subject of in-depth study at the SITdA National Conference on “Producing Project” (Reggio Calabria, 2018), and relaunched in a new perspective by the International Conference “The project in the digital age. Technology, Nature, Culture” scheduled in Naples on the 1st-2nd of July 2021. A reflection that Techne intends to further develop through the sharing of knowledge and scientific debate, selecting topics of great importance, to give voice to a new phase and recalling the practice of design research, in connection with the production context, institutions and social demand. “Inside the Polycrisis. The possible necessary” is the theme of the call we launched for n. 23, to plan the future despite the uncertainties and risks, foreshadowing strategies that support a unavoidable change, also by operating within the dynamics that, for better or for worse, will be triggered by the significant resources committed to the implementation of the Recovery Plan. To envisage systematic actions based on the centrality of a rational programming, of environmentally appropriate design at the architectural, urban and territorial scales, and of a continuous monitoring of the implementation processes. With the commitment also to promote, after each release, a public moment of reflection and critical assessment on the research progresses.

But also a «grandiose machine for the housing» (Samonà, 1949), based on a clear institutional and organizational reorganization, with the establishment of a single body (articulated in the plan implementation committee, led by Filiberto Guala, with regulatory functions of disbursement of funds, assignment of tasks and supervision, and in the INA-Casa Management directed by the architect Arnaldo Foschini, then dean of the Faculty of Architecture), which led to the construction of two million rooms for over 350,000 families.

      "In this study, tube well water, soil, crop, and vegetable were collected from agricultural field where irrigated with arsenic contaminated water. Estimation of total arsenic and other metals and metalloids in soil, vegetable, and paddy (rice & husk) samples by using ICP-MS after microwave digestion. But arsenic species in paddy (rice + husk), rice, husk, and vegetable by IC-ICP-MS after TFA extraction. Results show that the average arsenic concentration in contaminated soil, rice, and vegetable were 3.81, 3.62, and 5.66 times higher than the control samples, respectively. The overall observations indicated that arsenic concentration in vegetable and paddy were positively correlated with arsenic in soil. Also, for paddy arsenic concentration decreases shoot > seed (rice) > husk and in vegetables the distribution is leaf> stem > fruit. The regression analysis was carried out between arsenic and other metals in soil samples.  However, no significant co-relation was observed between As & Mn, As & Cu, As & Ni, or As & Pb. But a significant (<0.05) positive correlation found between As & Zn (r =+0.763, p = 0.027) and also a strong negative correlation was observed between As & Hg (r = -0.802, p = 0.009). Arsenic along with Se, Mn, Cu, Hg, Pb & Ni were analyzed in rice & husk of 3 paddy samples cultivated with arsenic contaminated water. The regression analysis was carried out between arsenic and other metals. Linear regression shown negative correlation between As & Se (r= -0.999, p = 0.018), As & Pb (r = -0.992, p = 0.078) and positive correlation between As & Cu (r =+0.998, p = 0.03). But no satisfactory correction observed between As & Mn, As & Hg, and As & Ni. It has been observed selenium concentration decreases with increase arsenic concentration in both rice and husk, collected from As contaminated field in Bangladesh. This has also been observed in two vegetable samples those we had studied. All analyzed elements concentration (µg/gm) were less in “Kachu (Taro)” comparing “Data (Stem amaranth)” except arsenic. Arsenic was very high in “Kachu” comparing “Data” even though they were irrigated with same water containing arsenic 205 µg/L. The overall conclusion from arsenic species analysis in rice, paddy (rice + husk), and some vegetables are that inorganic arsenic is the dominating species of arsenic. It appears from all four-rice analysis that inorganic arsenic is the major portion of arsenic in rice. All four-husk analysis shows only presence of inorganic arsenic. No methylated form of arsenic was found in any husk samples, but arsenic species in a paddy (rice+ husk) sample shows high inorganic arsenic (76.46%) and 19.37% DMA & 4.23% MMA. It shows presence of inorganic arsenic & DMA, and possibility of an unknown arsenic species in Lady's Finger. It was very high arsenic concentration in a vegetable named “Kachu” which grows inside soil a popular food in West Bengal-India and Bangladesh. Most interesting, its inorganic arsenic concentration is quite high, but it has no detectable amount of methylated form of arsenic and possible of an unknown arsenic species. Rice and vegetable are the staple food for poor villagers of Bangladesh and West Bengal-India. This is true for the villagers in Kolsur gram-panchayet (G.P.) in Deganga block of North 24-Parganas district, West Bengal-India, where we studied for arsenic in soil, rice, and vegetable from 10 plots cultivated with arsenic contaminated water. From the results of total arsenic (drinking water + rice + vegetable + Pantavat (rice mixed with water) + water added for food preparation) body burden to North Kolsur villagers is 1185.0 µg for per adult per day and 653.2 µg for per child per day. Amount of arsenic coming from rice, vegetable, and water added for Pantavat and food preparation is 485 µg i.e., 41% of total for adult and 253.2 µg i.e., 38.8% for child, and from rice and vegetable 285 µg i.e., 24% of total for adult and 153.2 µg i.e., 23.4% for child (around age 10 years). Our findings show most of the arsenic coming from food is inorganic in nature. As toxicity of most of the organic arsenic compounds in food is less compared to inorganic arsenic. Therefore, compared to worldwide arsenic consumption from food, it appears Kolsur villagers are also consuming high amount of inorganic arsenic from food and vegetable, and people appears also at risk from arsenic in food. Kolsur village is an example of many such villages in West Bengal-India and Bangladesh. Further, products from arsenic irrigated water- soil system rich in arsenic are also coming to common marketplace far away from contaminated areas and even people who are not drinking arsenic contaminated water may get arsenic from food products produced from contaminated fields. In West Bengal-India and Bangladesh rice, vegetable, and other products are coming to cities (including Kolkata in West Bengal-India and Dhaka in Bangladesh) from villages and possibility that city people consuming arsenic contaminated products from contaminated areas cannot be ruled out. Abbreviation: IC-ICP-MS, Ion chromatography-inductively coupled plasma-Mass spectrophotometry; FI-HG-AAS, Flow injection-hydride generation -atomic absorption spectrometry Introduction In West Bengal-India out of its total 18 districts in 9 districts arsenic in groundwater has been found over 50 µg/L. Total area and population of these 9 districts are 38,865 km2 and 42.7 million (approx.), respectively while the area and population of West Bengal are 88,000 km2 and 68 million (approx.). This does not mean that 42.7 million people in these 9 districts are drinking arsenic contaminated water and will suffer from arsenic toxicity, but no doubt they are at risk. In 9 affected districts of West Bengal, approximately 6 million people are drinking arsenic contaminated water at levels >50 µg/L. For arsenical skin lesions, we examined approx. 86,000 people in 7 affected districts out of 9 and 8500 (9.8%) people were registered with arsenical skin lesions. But we expect, from extrapolation of our generated data that nearly 300,000 people may have arsenical skin lesions in West Bengal-India. State, West Bengal is prosperous in agriculture. The state has surplus food production and main crops are paddy and vegetable. Land of these 9 contaminated districts of West Bengal is very fertile and all are in recent gangetic deltaic plain. Major quantum of food production of West Bengal is coming from these 9 districts and tens of thousands of small and big diameter tube wells are in use for irrigation purpose.  Plant needs a small fraction of the total water we pour to the field. Groundwater is considered to be the main source of water for agriculture and its use is increasing day by day. It has been noticed that even if surface water is available for irrigation from nearing source farmers are reluctant to use those sources if they must spend some extra money for this purpose. Except 5 months of rainy season (June-October) rest of the 7 months of the year farmers use groundwater for agriculture. Even during June to October if there are no rain farmers use groundwater. During 1996 it has been reported1 by School of Environmental Studies (SOES), Jadavpur University, and Kolkata that from a single Rural Water Supply Scheme (RWSS), Govt. of W. Bengal in Malda district, supplying water to a few villages, and 147.8 kg of arsenic came out during a year with groundwater. Therefore, it is expected that huge quantity of arsenic is falling on agricultural land from contaminated tube wells in use for irrigation. A follow-up study was made by SOES to know how much arsenic is falling on irrigated land in one year during cultivation from all 3200 tube wells that exist in the block Deganga of North 24-Parganas2.  The basis of calculation was like this: 3200 shallow tube wells of 7 cm to 10 cm diameter were used in 1997 in Deganga block for agriculture and average discharge rate was 20 m3/hr. electric / diesel pumps (average 5HP) were used.  These shallow tube wells used to run in average 7 hours per day for 7 months in a year.  We had analyzed 597 irrigation tube wells out of total 3200. Out of those 597 tube wells, 574 tube wells contain arsenic ≥10 µg/L.  The average arsenic concentration of the 574 tube wells was 70 µg/L (range 10 -840 µg/L). A calculation was   made to know how much arsenic is falling on soil from 3200 tube wells based on measurement of 574 tube wells (total analyzed) and extrapolating to 3200. The overall result shows from the block Deganga alone 6.4 tons of arsenic is falling on agricultural land in one year from 3200 agriculture tube wells. Thus, it appears that in West Bengal-India and Bangladesh a few thousand tons of arsenic is falling on agricultural land in every year. Total arsenic contribution through food for many developed countries have been reported3. Although sea food contains mainly nontoxic organic forms of arsenic and rapidly excreted     Figure 1. Location of Madaripur district of Bangladesh, and North 24-Parganas and Medinipur districts of India   through urine, but other than sea food inorganic arsenic may be the major contribution of arsenic in many foods. A study from Canada4,5 indicates that arsenic content of many foods is mainly inorganic in nature and typically in the range 65-75%. US-EPA reported that percentage of inorganic arsenic in rice, vegetables and fruits are 35%, 5% and 10% respectively6. It is reported that absorption of arsenic by plant is influenced by the concentration of arsenic in soil7. In arsenic affected areas of West Bengal-India and Bangladesh huge quantity of arsenic is falling on agricultural land and thus it will be interesting and very important to know whether there is an increase concentration of arsenic in vegetable and crops that grow in this region.   In this paper, I will report (a) the total arsenic concentration in soil, paddy (shoot, rice and husk), vegetable (including edible root, stem, leaf, and fruit) in 10 plots of land irrigated with arsenic contaminated water, (b) arsenic species in paddy (rice + husk), rice, husk, and in vegetable (also in edible root, stem, and fruit), (c) some metals and metalloids in soil, vegetable, rice. and husk, and (d) Arsenic body burden. METHODS AND MATERIALS Selection of study area Demography of the State West Bengal is 18 administrative districts and North 24- Parganas is one of the districts. North 24-Parganas is one of the 9 arsenic affected districts of West Bengal-India also. In North 24-Parganas there are 22 blocks/ police stations. Each block has several Gram Panchayets (G.P.) and in each G.P., there are several villages. We have chosen Deganga block of North 24- Parganas district as our study area. The reasons are, (A) we have the detail 8785 hand tube-wells water analysis report of Deganga one of the 22 blocks of North 24-Parganas (Table 1) and also 597 irrigation tube wells report out of 3200 which were used for irrigation in Deganga block alone (Table 2), (B) Deganga block is close (about 60 km) from our institute (SOES) with good road connection, and (C) we are working in this block for a long time and have good report with the villagers. Figure 1 shows arsenic affected block of North 24-Parganas and Deganga block. Deganga block has 13-gram panchayets and groundwater of all these gram pahchayets are arsenic contaminated (>50 µg/L). Out of 13-gram panchayets (G. P.), in 11 G. Ps we have identified patients with arsenical skin lesions.   We had chosen 10 fields in Kolsur (North) village of Deganga block under Kolsur gram panchayet. Table 3 shows the crops from 10 fields we had analyzed and other related information. For control study, we had chosen the district Medinipur, an area was groundwater arsenic concentration <3 µg/L; soils of the control area show arsenic in the range 5.31 µg/gm to 6.60 µg/gm (n=6). Overall information of control area is given in Table 4.           Table 1: Distribution of arsenic in tube wells water in Deganga, North 24-Parganas, West Bengal, India   Table 2: Distribution of arsenic in irrigated tube wells water in Deganga block, North 24-Parganas, West Bengal-India           Table 3: Type of crops and other information of 10 selected agricultural fields in Kolsur village of Deganga block, West Bengal, India      where arsenic contaminated ground water was used for irrigation purpose. Table 4:   Overall information of control area, where groundwater contains arsenic below 3 µg/L   21 months study report Studies had been carried for 21 months (August 1998 to April 2000). Table 5 shows the number of samples and time schedule of the whole study. Table 5: The number of samples and time schedule of the whole study (from August 1998 to April 2000) *   Instrumental Techniques The FI-HG-AAS was used in School of Environmental Studies (SOES), Jadavpur University, Kolkata, India A flow injection-hydride generation -      atomic absorption spectrometry (FI-HG-AAS) technique was used in our laboratory for analysis of total arsenic in water, soil, crop, and vegetable samples. The FI-HG­AAS system was assembled from commercially available instruments and accessories in our laboratory. A Perkin-Elmer Model 3100 spectrometer equipped with a Hewlett-Packard Vectra computer with GEM software, Perkin-Elmer EDL System-2, arsenic lamp (lamp current 400 mA), and Varian AAS Model Spectra AA-20 with hollow-cathode As lamp (lamp current 10 mA) were used. The flow injection assembly consists of an injector, Teflon T-piece, tigon tubing and other parts for the FI system from Omni-fit UK. The peristaltic pump (VGA-76) from Varian and Minipuls-3, Gilson, Model M 312 (France) were incorporated into the FI system. Details of the instrumentation have been discussed in our earlier publications3,4. A Heraeus muffle furnace fitted with manual temperature control was used for dry ashing. The ICP-MS was used in National Institute of Health Sciences (NIHS), Tokyo, Japan A microwave digestion system (MDS-2100) from CEM Innovators in Microwave Technology, USA with a rotor for twelve Teflon digestion vessels HP-500, was used for sample digestion using HNO3 and H2O2. The ICP-MS was used from Department of Environmental Chemistry, National Institute of Health Sciences, Tokyo, Japan. Estimation of arsenic and other metals and metalloids in soil, vegetable, and paddy, (rice & husk) have been carried out by ICP-MS method. Analytical results of SRM digested similarly and analyzed by ICP-MS. The instrumental conditions of this system are shown in Table 6.     Table 6: Instrumental conditions for ICP-MS   The IC-ICP-MS was used from Department of U.S. Food & Drug Administration, Forensic Chemistry Center, Cincinnati, USA. The IC-ICP-MS was used from Department of U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Forensic Chemistry Center, Cincinnati, USA. The chromatographic system used consisted of a model GP 50 ion chromatography pump (Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA, USA), AS 3500 autosampler (Thermo Separations Products, San Jose, CA, USA) and a non-metallic automated switching valve (Waters, Milford, MA, USA) with 20 µL injection loop between the Column outlet and ICP-MS nebulizer. Operation of the valve was controlled using signal relays from the IC pump. A model PQ3 ICP-MS (VG Elemental) operating under normal multi-element tuning condition was used for chromatographic detection. Column effluent was directed to the concentric nebulizer and cooled conical spray chamber of the ICP-MS using a length (~60 em) of 0.25 mm. i.d. PEEK® tubing. An anion exchange column, Hamilton PRP-X 100 (4.6 x 150 mm), was used for separation of arsenic species.   Chemicals and Reagents School of Environmental Studies, Jadavpur University, West Bengal, India All reagents were of analytical grade. Distilled demonized water was used throughout. Standard arsenic solutions were prepared by dissolving appropriate amounts of As2O3 (Merck, Germany) and standard arsenic (V) Titrisol (Merck, Germany).  Standard stock solutions were stored in glass bottles and kept refrigerated. Dilute arsenic solutions for analysis were prepared daily. The reducing solution was sodium tetrahydroborate (Merck, Germany) 1.5% (m/v) in 0.5% (m/v) sodium hydroxide (E. Merck, India Limited). The HCl (E. Merck, India Limited) concentration was 5M. Ashing acid suspension was prepared by stirring 10% (w/v) Mg(NO3)2. 6H2O and 1% (w/v) MgO in water until homogeneous4. Standard reference materials were used to check the accuracy of the method. Pond Sediment NIES- 2, from the National Institute for Environmental Studies, Japan; Standard Chinese River Sediment 81-101 (of 1981); San Joaquin Soil SRM 2709, Citrus Leaves SRM 1572, Rice Flour SRM 1568a, Spinach Leaves SRM 1570a and Tomato Leaves SRM 1573a are from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), USA. In National Institute of Health Sciences, Tokyo, Japan All reagents were of analytical reagent grade. Milli-Q Water (Yamato Millipore filter, WT 100) was used throughout. Stock solutions (10 mg/L in water) of arsenic and other elements (Se, Cu, Zn, Pb, Mn, Ni, Hg) were prepared separately from 1000 mg/L stock standard (Cica-Merck, Kanta Chemical Co. Inc, Japan) of each element. All stock solutions were stored in polyethylene bottles and kept at 4°C. Dilute solutions (2.5, 5, 10, 20, 30, and 50 µg/L) for analysis were prepared daily. The samples digestion was carried out with concentrated nitric acid (HNO3) (Wako Pure Chemical Industries Ltd., Osaka, Japan) and high purity hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) (Wako Pure Chemical Industries Ltd., Osaka, Japan). Standard reference materials were used to check the accuracy of the method for multi element analysis. Rice flour SRM 1568a, Apple leaves SRM 1515, Tomato Leaves SRM 1573a, San Joaquin Soil SRM 2709, and Spinach leaves SRM 1570a are from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), USA.   In U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Cincinnati, U.S.A. Ultrapure deionized water was used (DIW, Millipore, MA, USA). High-purity ammonium hydroxide was from Fisher Scientific (Fair Lawn, NJ, USA). Anhydrous trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) was from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA), and ammonium nitrate, and monobasic ammonium phosphate were from J.T. Baker (Phillipsburg, NJ, USA). Commercial stock standards of As(III) and As(V) (1000 µg As/mL as As2O3 in 2% HCl and H3AsO4. ½ H2O in 2% HNO3, respectively) were obtained from Spex Industries (Metuchen, NJ, USA). Dimethylarsinic acid (98.0%) and disodium methyl arsenate (99%) were obtained from Chem Service (West Chester, PA, USA). The mobile phase consisted of 10 mM NH4H2PO4 and 10 mM NH4PO3 adjusted to a pH of 6.3 with NH4OH. NIST SRM 1568a rice flour was used for method validation Sample collection and preservation Water samples Tube well water samples were collected in pre-washed (with 1:1 HNO3) polyethylene bottles. After collection concentrated nitric acid (1.0 ml per liter) was added as preservative. Samples, which were not analyzed immediately, were kept in a refrigerator at 4°C. Details of the collection procedure have been described in our earlier publications3,4. Vegetable and crop samples Vegetable and crop samples were collected from selected agricultural fields where arsenic contaminated water was used for agricultural purposes. Vegetable, crop, and plant samples were picked by hand, stored in polyethylene bags, and kept cool until processing in the lab. Samples were washed thoroughly with tap water to remove soil and other particles, and finally washed in sonicator with demonized water for several times. Prior to sample washing, plants consisting of both roots (below soil surface) and shoots (above soil surface) were separated into root, stem, leaf, and fruit as a sub samples and dry matter yields after drying at 60°C for about 72 hours. Dry samples made fine powder by Agate pestle and mortar, sieved, and stored in polyethylene bags with proper leveling at room temperature. Soil samples Surface soil samples and samples at different depth were collected from agricultural fields, where arsenic contaminated water was used for agricultural purposes and samples were also collected from non-arsenic contaminated agricultural fields (arsenic concentration in agricultural water was <3 µg/L). We collected four soil samples from different part of the same field and made a mixture. Samples were picked by non-metallic spoon, stored in polyethylene bags, and kept cool until processing in the lab. First soil samples were dried at room temperature and finally at 60°C for several hours. Dried samples were made fine powder by Agate pestle and mortar, sieved, and stored in polyethylene bags with proper leveling at room temperature.   Sample treatment for analysis In SOES Laboratory Sand bath digestion of soil samples Approximately 0.10 to 0.50 gm of soil sample was placed in a 25cc conical flask (glass), 2 mL deionized water added, followed by 2 mL concentrated HNO3 and 1 mL concentrated H2SO4 (Analar Grade, E. Merck, India). The mouth of the flask was covered with a small glass funnel. Then it was heated on a sand bath until the fumes of SO3 evolved. When fumes of SO3 evolved, heating was discontinued and after cooling, the solution was diluted and filtered through a millipore membrane (0.45µm pore size) filtering apparatus, then adjusted to fixed volume. Standard Reference Materials (SRM) was analyzed in the same way to test the accuracy. Dry ashing digestion of vegetable and crop samples Approximately 0.20 to 0.70 gm of dry vegetable/ crop sample or 1.5 gm to 3.0 gm of wet/weight vegetable sample was taken into a 100 ml Borosil Conical Flask and 10 ml ashing aid [10% (w/v) Mg(NO3)2. 6H2O (Riedel-De Haenag, Seelze- Hannover, Germany) + 1% (w/v) MgO (E. Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) in deionized water] was added with continuous agitation. Then 5 mL HNO3 (40%, v/v) was added and evaporated to almost dryness on a hot plate at about 90-100°C. When the sample dried, the beakers were covered with a pre-washed watch glass and transferred to the muffle furnace2. The following temperature program was adopted for proper ashing of the sample: 150°C for l hr, 200°C for 30 min, 250°C for 30 min, 300°C for 2 hrs, 400°C for l hr, and 450°C for 12-14 hrs. After cooling to room temperature 2 mL (10% v/v) HNO3 was added to the carbonaceous residue. The mixture was dried again on the hot plate to dryness and transferred to the furnace. The ash was subjected again to the following temperature program: 150°C for 1 hr and 30 min, 300°C for 30 min, and 450°C for 12- 14hrs. After cooling the white ash was moistened with a few drops of water, dissolved in 1-2 mL 6M HCI and filtered through a Millipore filter (0.45 µm) and finally made the proper volume with 6M HCl. Triplicate blanks and Standard Reference Materials (SRM) were-prepared following the same digestion procedure. Microwave digestion of soil, vegetable, and crop samples in NIHS, Tokyo, Japan Samples for digestion were weighed (0.2 gm to 0.5 gm of dry sample) in the Teflon vessel and added 2:1 v/v of nitric acid and hydrogen peroxide. The vessels were closed using the lid provided. For safety of the vessel, rupture membrane was inserted in the lid. Vessels were set in the turn table of the micro-wave digestion machine and the below settings were programmed (Table 7).     Table 7: Optimum parameters for sample digestion by microwave system       After cooling for 30 minutes, the vessels were opened carefully. Each digested solution was transferred quantitatively to a 10 mL volumetric flask and adjust to fixed volume with Milli-Q water. Finally, it was filtered through a Millipore membrane (0.45 µm) (CASL 45 2.5 CMD, membrane: Acetyl Cellulose) and kept in plastic container for analysis. The Standard Reference Materials (SRM) were digested under the same digestion procedure. Preparation and extraction of crop and vegetable samples for arsenic speciation (FDA lab, USA) The rice and vegetable samples were grounded in an acid-washed glass mortar and pestle. A larger amount of each of the paddy sample was shipped; therefore, they were milled and sieved (0.5 mm) in a model ZM 100 ultra-centrifugal mill (Retsch, Haan Germany). Prepared samples were stored in HDPE bottles at ambient temperature prior to use. Sample (0.1-0.5gm) were mixed with 0.5-2 mL of 2M trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and allowed to stand for 6 hours at 100°C in either a 15 mL or a 60 mL capped HDPE centrifuge tube. The TFA extract was allowed to cool and diluted to volume (10-25 mL) with Ultrapure deionized water (DIW, Millipore, MA USA). Extracts were filtered through a 0.45 µm Nylon syringe filter prior to analysis by IC-ICP-MS.   Sample analysis Flow injection-hydride generation-atomic absorption spectrometry (Fl-HG-AAS)  (SOES Lab.) The sample was injected into a carrier stream of 5M HCl by means of a six-port sample injection valve fitted with a 50 µL sample loop. The injected sample, together with carrier solution met subsequently with a continuous stream of sodium tetrahydroborate. Mixing with sodium tetrahydroborate generated hydride, which subsequently entered the ice water bath and then the gas-liquid separator apparatus, which was cooled with ice-cold water. This cooling procedure and the design of the gas-liquid separator are more efficient than conventional FI-AAS and the possibility of water vapor entering the quartz cell is reduced to a great extent. Inside this apparatus a continuous flow of N2 carrier gas assists mixing and the reaction and subsequently carries hydride to the quartz tube mounted in the air-acetylene flame for As measurement. Peak signals were recorded using a computer linked to the atomic absorption spectrophotometer (AAS) that is capable of both peak height and peak area measurement.  The peak height signals were measured and the concentrations of arsenic of the samples were measured/calculated against the standard curve. The experimental condition for FI-HG-AAS system is given in the Table 8.   Table 8: Optimum-Parameters for arsenic determination by flow infection (FI) system     Water Samples Preserved water samples (in 1 mL HNO3 per liter of water) were analyzed by FI-HG-AAS against arsenite and arsenate mixture (1:1) as the standard. Soil, vegetable, and crop samples Digested samples were analyzed by Fl-HG-AAS method against arsenate as the standard. Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrophotometry (ICP-MS) (NIHS Lab., Japan) ICP-MS Analysis ICP-MS is an element selective detector. Twenty microliters (20 µL) of the microwave acid digested sample were injected into a carrier stream of Milli-Q water with a sample loop. The Chromatographic areas were measured, and the concentrations of elements were calculated against the individual element standard curve. The experimental conditions of ICP-MS are given in Table 6.   Ion chromatography-inductively coupled plasma-Mass spectrophotometry (IC-ICP-MS) (Food & Drug Lab., USA) Figure 7 shows the chromatogram obtained for a standard mixture of As(III), DMA, MMA and As(V) in our experimental condition (Table 9). Each of the arsenic species is present at an arsenic concentration of 2 ng/mL. Data was collected for 10 minutes. The four arsenic species are baseline resolved in under 8.5 minutes; however, arsenobetaine (AsB) is not resolved from As(III) under these separation conditions. AsB is generally found in fish and shellfish samples and is not expected to be present in vegetable or rice samples collected from arsenic contaminated agricultural fields. The precision of peak areas measured over a period of 4 hours (n=5) using replicate 25 µL injections of a standard containing 2 ng/mL each of As(III), DMA, MMA and As(V) was 4.8%, 4.4%, 4.1%, and 9.0%, respectively. As estimate of the instrumental detection limit (IDL) for each of the arsenic species was calculated based on 3 times, the standard deviation of peak area measurements for replicate 25 µl injections of a standard containing 0.2 ng As/mL each of As(III), DMA, MMA and As(V). The IDLs were 0.1, 0.1, 0.1 and 0.2 ng/mL for As(III), DMA, MMA and As(V), respectively.   Table 9. IC-ICP-MS operational condition     Samples were analyzed using calibration standards at 0.5, 1, 2, 5 and 10 ng/mL concentrations (in some cases a 20 ng/mL standard was also used). Peak areas were corrected for any drift associated with the flow injection signal at the beginning of each chromatogram. The concentrations of several samples were also checked using standard addition.   Spikes of each of the arsenic species were taken through the method and spike recoveries of 83%, 88%, 100%, and 93% were obtained for As(III), As(V), MMA and DMA, respectively. However. it should be noted that As(V) can be partially reduced during the extraction procedure. The As(V) recovery was calculated in spiked samples using the sum of the increase in the As(III) and As(V) concentrations. Because of this partial reduction, the method is only capable of providing total inorganic arsenic as the sum of the As(III) and As(V) concentrations. Standard NIST SRM 1568a Rice Flour also analyzed by the same procedure and the sum of the arsenic species concentrations for SRM Rice Flour (0.27 µg/gm) compared well with the certified total arsenic value (0.29 µg/gm).   Total arsenic in irrigation tube wells, soil, vegetable, paddy samples were analyzed by using FI-HG-AAS after dry ashing (vegetable, rice, and husk) and acid digestion (soil) Water samples used for cultivation had been collected from 10 locations and analyzed by FI-HG­ AAS method and their results are given in Table 10. Similarly, soil samples had   Table 10: Analysis of arsenic and iron for 10 irrigation tube-well used in 10 fields for cultivation         Table 11: Analysis of arsenic in soil where arsenic contaminated groundwater was used for cultivation   Table 12: Distribution of arsenic concentration in different parts of the vegetable collected from 6 fields out of 10 irrigated with arsenic contaminated water Table 13:  Distribution of arsenic concentration in different parts of paddy plant collected from 3 selected location of Kolsur (N) in Deganga block, North 24-Parganas, West Bengal, India during monsoon period and rainwater was used for cultivation Table 14: Distribution of arsenic concentration in different parts of paddy plant collected from 5 selected fields of Kolsur (N) village in Deganga block, North 24-Parganas, West Bengal, India during pre-monsoon period and cultivated with arsenic contaminated groundwater Table 15: Analytical results of Standard Reference Matarial (SRM) by FI-HG-AAS   Arsenic concentration in irrigation tube well and soil before and after a devastating flood During September 2000 to October 2000 of our 10 experimental Fields were submerged with water due to a devastating flood.
